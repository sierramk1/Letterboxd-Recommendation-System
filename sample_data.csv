edmond,ev1lcatboy,,i hate this fuck ass movie. no further thoughts
stream,ev1lcatboy,6,thanks jeff
the-garfield-movie,ev1lcatboy,,was not worth free pretzel bites. im just not the target audience
bad-cgi-gator,ev1lcatboy,2,1 star for the gator
monkey-man,ev1lcatboy,10,holy shit
what-the-do-we-know,ev1lcatboy,,found this at an antique store for 5 dollars. not worth it
shin-ultraman,ev1lcatboy,10,ultraman....save me......
onyx-the-fortuitous-and-the-talisman-of-souls,ev1lcatboy,6,"Holy crap. I don't think i actually *loved* this, but it was a fun time. A little too in-your-face about how self aware it is, with Onyx in particular, but all around a good time. Really Really Reallly good practical effects, fun stuff from Jeffrey Combs, great set design, etc. Song choices were great. I've watched a LOT worse for Jcombs. Probably would not watch again, but I will definitely look back on this fondly. Lot of love poured into this. Wish it was a little shorter"
uhf,ev1lcatboy,10,best movie ever made. nothing compares
puppet-master-vs-demonic-toys,ev1lcatboy,,i want to play with toys
five-nights-at-freddys,ev1lcatboy,3,"Holy shit. I really wanted to like this movie. Like really badly. I went into this with the mindset that if this was bad, I'd still enjoy it, and if it was good I would have a good FNAF movie. I can see the love from set designers and the animatronics puppetry and such.... but really nothing else. The story felt hollow and cheap, the pacing was seriously the worst I've seen in a while, and there was seemingly no tension. I could go on for a LONG time about how I feel about this, but mostly I'm just bummed."
get-out-2017,ev1lcatboy,10,Holy shit.

And soon I'll let go too.""i can understand why it‚Äôs not for everyone but this taps into a lot of personal ‚Äúhorrors‚Äù for me. the horror isn‚Äôt a jump scare or a vengeful spirit, it‚Äôs about forgetting yourself and the people you love slowly. it‚Äôs about grief and the mutability of memory. as someone who has dementia running through‚Ä¶"

mid90s,dyketactics,6,so much of this is so so good. we need to bring back 16mm features fr üôèüèªbut a lot of the momentum is ruined for me by the decision to show¬†a 28 year old actress in a sex scene with an 11 year old actor. i get that they wanted to portray rape/grooming but there is a way to show this without perpetuating it in your cast (pen15 does this well by using body doubles). also it was really uncomfortable to hear everyone in the theater laughing in reaction to the scene when emmy and i were trying not to throw up üò≠üò≠

janet-planet,dyketactics,5,"god this was such a slog. i‚Äôm sorry. some of the worst projection i‚Äôve seen from a theater ever. screen felt like i could have just stayed home and watched from my ipad. ¬†there was no ac in the theater and i was fighting nausea the whole time. the cheeseburger i ate was nottttt sitting right. also about 30% of the theater was senile, asleep, snoring or all of the above.¬†i connected with certain aspects of this but a‚Ä¶"

astrids-self-portrait,dyketactics,6,i want to know¬†what rena would make if she had access to a big budget. not that this isn‚Äôt good but i see so much potential in her ideas and would love to see them executed on a larger scale. a lot of the ‚Äúbad‚Äù filmmaking took me out of this one. and that gaudy 2010s coastal wine mom decor in the house. good god.
fly-me-to-the-moon-2024,dyketactics,4,uncanny valley ass movie‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm convinced that they already have AI writing these scripts‚Ä¶ and lighting these setsi feel like the sheer amount of incredibly bad screenplays i‚Äôve had to witness this year have just taught me that i could write a movie because it‚Äôs not that hard to write something so incredibly mid. so many beats in this are bad or just plain unbelievable. upset the space nerd in me.
jug-face,dyketactics,7,really good for an indie horror with limited locations. i thought the characters were great.
safe-is-desire,dyketactics,,if the lesbian porn doesn‚Äôt have a montage of the main character drinking away their sorrows related to their past traumas while a kd lang-esque song plays in the background i don‚Äôt want it

national-anthem-2023,dyketactics,8,i want to circle back and write something longer but i‚Äôm just gonna say i really liked this‚Ä¶.
oddity-2024,dyketactics,7,i walked into the theater for the 11pm showing and i was the only person there‚Ä¶ kept hearing breathing tho. so maybe that environment is why i found this to be pretty creepy and scary. jump scares were used effectively after the right amount of tension. i also think i‚Äôm just more affected by ghosts. especially ones that don‚Äôt haunt out of a malice but ones that haunt because they are not at rest. there‚Äôs something so deeply sad about‚Ä¶
old-lesbians,dyketactics,,"‚Äúthey‚Äôre going to find out i‚Äôm not like them but they can‚Äôt tell yet because i don‚Äôt look any different‚Äù¬†this was incredible. to view this in the same room as about 100 lesbians of all ages was truly special. encapsulated many feelings i had myself, despite being born about 80 years after most of these women!! the inter-generational lesbian commonality is so beautiful to witness. and¬†the stop motion animation was such a good touch that really sold it for me!!"
the-flesh-of-fallen-angels,dyketactics,,"was definitely expecting something different (more narrative). but this music video-esque, channel-switching vibe is cool. this feels like something i would see projected at market hotel and rave to (back when i used to go out and have fun and be cool)"
didi-2024,dyketactics,8,"screened at momi with sean wang q&asuch a cute, well-written, well-acted slice of life. takes itself just seriously enough.the filmmaker mentioned¬†the 400 blows as a reference and i totally see the similarity in emotionality."
love-lies-bleeding-2024,dyketactics,10,have a feeling since i now own this movie it‚Äôs going to become like the first half hour of bound to me‚Ä¶.

zero-day,dyketactics,8,"i‚Äôm part of the post-columbine generation. for as long as i can remember, we were taught how to defend ourselves against school shooters, what to do and say to first responders, and participating in monthly drills.¬†from a young age we were essentially traumatized under the guise of it being for our ‚Äúprotection.‚Äù so maybe it‚Äôs just because of the time i was born but i feel like people my age have become very desensitized surrounding school shootings.¬†many of us did‚Ä¶"
body-double,dyketactics,10,i had to go to the movie theater to return the vhs tapes i rented from them and they were playing body double so i went to see it. coincidentally the movie patrick bateman is returning when he says he needs to return some video tapes. everything is meta.

damsel-2024,lanmar,4,".¬†I didn't think I'd watch it but my sister encouraged me. ¬†I think the film is very average, although it has some good elements like Millie Bobby Brown who does quite well (although I think she deserves better movies) and visual effects and music are also quite good.¬†But the big minus is the too simple plot, almost everything is predictable, even despite these plot twists, although on the other hand it's an ordinary film produced by Netflix so what did I expect?"
maxxxine,lanmar,7,"I love this atmosphere of the 80s with horror and¬†anxiety, I think this movie captured it all perfectly.¬†Mia Goth is phenomenal as always, but I didn't expect anything else,¬†she is a real star! The film itself is good,¬†direction and roles of actors, nostalgia for horror movies from the 80s, topics related to Hollywood, soundtrack, although I have the impression that at some point the plot lacks a bit of coherence.But all in all, it's still a movie worth watching, and a worthy conclusion to the trilogy.¬†By the way, I already know who¬†I'll dress up as this halloween."
challengers,lanmar,6,".¬†I have a problem with this film,¬†everyone raves about it, but in my opinion it was so bland.¬†The characters were very mean,¬†so it was hard to root for anyone,the dialogues were often very embarrassing, I felt like I was watching a slow motion film all the time. Even though¬†I like Luca's films, I didn't like this one."
back-to-black,lanmar,,".¬†I don't think Amy would like this film,I think a lot of things were wrong or inaccurate,¬†this ending didn't really suit me either"

dangerous-crossing,mnaves,9,"A cursory internet search reveals that this sea-bound noir can't get any love. Allow me, then, to pile on the love: Jeanne Crain is gorgeous, Joseph LaShelle's cinematography is gorgeous and Joseph M. Newman directs--well, if not gorgeously, then with impressive fluidity. A young heiress loses her husband under mysterious circumstances while on a honeymoon-at-sea. The ending reveal is genuinely surprising even if the requisite plot points aren't. Foggiest movie ever."

Here she doubles down in as both a mother and daughter bound my a man with a runaway gambling addiction. Eye-catching (or just plain odd) musical numbers are coupled with overripe plot twists and stilted comedic byways. Directed by Youssef Chahine who is bristling with talent but has yet to get his sea legs."
fright,mnaves,5,"Ahead of its time yet likely to get slagged off as derivative, ""Fright"" is a serviceable thriller that is never as good as its cast--particularly, Susan George and Honor Blackman--nor as good as the man at the helm, Peter Collinson.

Good show all around with some sharp flashes of insight and credible comedy support."
straight-on-till-morning,mnaves,6,"Like a good Patricia Highsmith novel, this movie features characters who are either amoral or naive and then details the misadventures that ensue when they meet. Like a bad Patricia Highsmith novel, this movie begs credulity when it doesn't hit the mark. That, and the plot takes forever-and-a-day to get moving.

dr-terrors-house-of-horrors,mnaves,5,"Dr. Terror is actually Dr. Schreck which gives Peter Cushing the latitude to engage in a so-so German accent, all the while transforming a train car into the ""horror"" house mentioned in the title. An anthology of morality tales with supernatural trappings, this movie is well acted, charming in a rickety old way and not recommended to people who haven't made this kind of thing their life's blood. Amicus's first foray into horror movies."

from-beyond-the-grave,mnaves,8,"Made on the cheap, as Amicus movies tended to be, this picture nonetheless holds up impressively well in its production values: the settings here look good and are important components in the stories that are told here. The actors are on top of their game--Donald Pleasance is particularly unsettling, as is daughter Angela--and the funny story in this quartet is genuinely funny. Not a film for the ages, but a film that has aged better than any reasonable person could have expected."
in-cold-blood,mnaves,9,"Yeah, Quincy Jones' soundtrack veers between being incongruous and show-offy and the picture doesn't end so much as peter out. On the whole, however, director Richard Brooks--who also did the screenplay adaptation of the Truman Capote book--brings an unnerving v√©rit√© to the proceedings even when things get a mite preachy or Freudian. Credit Robert Blake and Scott Wilson for keeping it real or, at least, as real as fiction will allow."
the-virgin-soldiers,mnaves,8,"""One reason the film is a discovery could be that its director, John Dexter (1925-90), was less a cinematic auteur than a man of the theater.

the-pearls-of-the-crown,mnaves,8,"How much you enjoy this film depends on (a) one's fondness for Sacha Guitry's (largely deserved) ego and (b) the bifurcated structure of the picture. Tracing the history of seven pearls through a bevy of royal, religious and sexual intrigues, Guitry utilizes three languages, a sometimes confusing abundance of historical illusions and a surfeit of ambition. The first half of the film is a tour de force; the second half, catch-as-catch-can. Still, there's much to take pleasure here, not least the auteur's whipsmart irreverance."
madhouse,mnaves,3,"""Madhouse"" didn't do much at the box office thereby putting an end to Vincent Price as a marquee moneymaker. It's a sad, muddled affair this picture: the self-referentiality doesn't add to the story, Peter Cushing isn't given much to do and the suspense is pretty much nil. That, and what's up with the crazy lady in the basement? Robert Quarry does connect as a sleazy film producer; that's something."
skinamarink,mnaves,5,"What begins as an interesting experiment in suggestion, suspense and resolution--that would be all the fuzzy camerawork--turns into an endurance test that overstays its welcome by a good 20-minutes. Two small children wander the darkened byways of their famiy home. Dad is missing; mom is catatonic--or close to it. What hobgoblin is pestering them so? Insufferable, indulgent and--dammit!--intriguing."
women-of-the-night-1948,mnaves,7,"A no-holds-barred depiction of a devastated post-war Japan doesn't descend into melodrama so much as grab it by the neck. Each time one of our female leads--Kinuyo Tanaka, Sanae Takasugi and Tomie Tsunoda--is at the mercy of political forces or patriarchal abuse, ""Women of the Night"" zigzags between high moral dudgeon and over-the-top exaggeration. Director Kenji Mizoguchi imbues the hellscape with a soft poetic mien and a wandering eye for narrative."

when-we-lost-to-the-germans,mnaves,10,"Daring, subtle and devastating. Here is childhood, not as imagined in retrospect, but as it is in life. An undersung masterwork."
the-squeaker-1937,mnaves,4,"An odd one, here: a pseudo noir that is also part musical, part screwball comedy, part police procedural and part Alistair Sim hamming it up as a newspaper journalist. The latter is the best part of a movie, but even Sim can't redeem a picture that is never as charming or as thrilling as it wants to be."
the-leopard-man,mnaves,6,"With director Jacques Tourneur at the helm--following boss Val Lewton's imprimatur, of course--""The Leopard Man"" gets by more on style than on substance. A bevy of young women are meeting their demise in New Mexico by what looks like a big cat. Though the Hispanic backdrop has its interests, the characters are more generic than usual and their repartee is stiff. But shadows? There are plenty of them and well deployed, as usual. Minor."
blackout-2023,mnaves,4,"Goddammit: the movies of writer and director Larry Fessenden are full of funny, telling and sharp moments that never quite coalesce into coherent entertainments. Frustrating. Would that Fessenden would ease up already with the political undercurrents and concentrate, instead, on flow, concision and finding leads who are as interesting as the supporting actors. That, and--hey--let's get scary!"
a-womans-face-1938,mnaves,7,"Ingrid Bergman plays a blackmailer who undergoes a moral transformation predicated, in significant part, by a physical transformation. ""A Woman's Face"" has a great cast peppering a so-so melodrama, but let me tell you: when Bergman embraces the dark side she's scarier than Darth Vader ever was. A likable curio and a job done well."

sapphire,mnaves,6,"What is it about director Basil Dearden that prevents him from being top tier in his field? ""Sapphire"" has been lauded for its forward-looking view on race, but the police procedural on which it centers is fairly run-of-the-mill. Notwithstanding a stark opening scene and its daring peek into the byways of 1950s Britain, this film is disappointing on the whole. Perhaps progressivism isn't a coefficient of good art?"
the-upturned-glass,mnaves,8,"Complaints about the slow build-up to this Hitchcockian tale of revenge served cold miss the point. The nail-biting denouement--really, the last 30 minutes or so--benefits from director Lawrence Huntington's laying out the facts for us just so only to throw in the monkey wrench. The plot has its share of unlikely tangents, but the characters are all pretty great, not least the avaricious Kate Howard (Pamela Kellino) and the beyond cynical Dr. Farrell (Brefni O'Rorke). James Mason is on his game throughout a thriller which I likely overrate but esteem all the same."

summer-light-1943,mnaves,6,"An exquisite example of filmmaking is tempered, if not entirely quashed, by characters so off-putting that it becomes increasingly difficult to care about their travails as the plot commences. Class distinctions are picked apart and, maybe, there's a commentary here on the German occupation of France. Jean Gr√©millon's version of ""The Rules of The Game""; take it or leave it."
brainstorm,mnaves,8,"Really? This was directed by the same William Conrad who starred in the television series ""Cannon"" and ""Jake & The Fatman?"" I'll be damned: this picture ain't bad at all. Certainly, it's well directed--which a story as far-fetched as this one had better be. A brilliant young scientist murders his lover's husband but pleads insanity to get off scott-free. Or so he thinks. After that, things get complicated. For my money, ""Brainstorm"" tops the over-rated ""Shock Corridor."" A find."
the-mutations,mnaves,3,"A vintage copy of ""Castle of Frankenstein""--number 22, to be exact, and in very good condition--sent me here and, alas, piqued my curiosity. How I missed this cinematic hodgepodge of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Freaks"" at my local grindhouse back in the day is a mystery. Why I watched it as a middle-aged man is a mystery too, I suppose. Notwithstanding some interesting production and creature design here, this is an abysmal film."
his-kind-of-woman,mnaves,8,"Producer Howard Hughes' meddling in this project undoubtedly contributed to what's good about--that is to say, its ramshackle structure and blatant incongruities. What this movie is, more or less, is a film noir musical satire on celebrity arrogance and Hollywood fatuousness. Still, Jane Russell and Robert Mitchum stir some loins, Vincent Price doles out the ham and Raymond Burr does a dry run for his turn in ""Vertigo"" if not ""Perry Mason."" A hoot."
lady-killer-1937,mnaves,9,"My second Jean Gr√©millon film in as many nights has left me wondering why his accomplishment is, if not unknown, then considerably less discussed than that of Jean Renoir. Here the redoubtable Jean Gabin is bedeviled by Mireille Balin, a femme fatale whose womanly prerogative is still shocking to behold. Tender moments of comedy alternate with haunting imagery and, in the end, ineluctable tragedy. Worth discovering."
the-strange-monsieur-victor,mnaves,8,"Call it what you'd like: a takedown of bourgeois hypocrisy or a meditation on the limitations of guilt. Jean Gr√©millon's picture about a provincial businessman and fulltime fence begins like a comedy and then gets down to the grubby business at hand: how much is a life worth? As the title figure, Raimu proves himself adept at shtick, but not so much at soul--which is why Gr√©millon brings the focus to Pierre Blanchar and, especially, Madeleine Renaud. An almost masterpiece."

the-shawshank-redemption,blu_ray33,10,What can actually even be said about The Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already been said a million times before. I think it's one of those films like Goodfellas that you could show to just about anyone and they wouldn't be able to tell you without lying that they didn't enjoy it on some level. It's just simply an incredibly empowering and epic watch that hits in the universal themes of the human spirit triumphing in the face of adversity and the power of comradary. What a film!!10/10

woman-of-the-hour,ianboolocklock,7,"The biggest takeaway I have from WOMAN OF THE HOUR is that, Anna Kendrick can direct. The first half of the movie did start off shaky and disjointed.

This one felt honest about female desire since our lead character is a young teenager and her raging hormones.‚Ä¶"
nocturnal-uproar-1979,ianboolocklock,6,"Out of all the Catherine Breillet movies I‚Äôve seen so far, her second feature NOCTURNAL UPROAR is the least shocking.

It‚Äôs a great movie for spooky season."
double-blind-2023-1,ianboolocklock,7,"I had no expectations going into DOUBLE BLIND. Well this is a decent and effective horror movie. For a movie that's low budget, it looked good.

Also, a very good lead performance by Millie Brady."
the-turnaround-2024,ianboolocklock,9,"I think instead of booing a struggling athlete, we should all be like Jon McCann and give that athlete a standing ovation when he or she is on the floor. Hey at least it worked for Trea Turner and the Phillies in 2023. As a sports and a movie fan, THE TURNAROUND reminded me of why I turn to sports and movies when I'm feeling down. Only 25 minutes long and this one inspired me that we need to be nice to each other instead of being mean and beating someone that's down."
lux-aeterna-2019,ianboolocklock,7,At first I thought Gasper Noe was making a film about two women talking for 50 minutes. Then the second half comes. That is some of the coolest use of strobe lighting I‚Äôve seen. It made the experience worth it because this is the definition of a style that makes up for the lack of substance.
baby-reindeer,ianboolocklock,9,"Yeah, this is definitely worthy of all the hype and more. I‚Äôm so glad that someone as brave as Richard Gadd can tell his story in this seven episode miniseries. It‚Äôs not an easy watch if you‚Äôre a victim of abuse. What BABY REINDEER does so well is showing the trauma and pain someone goes through after abuse. I like that near the end of the series it says if you need help it‚Äôs okay to ask for it. One of the best shows I‚Äôve seen so far in 2024. Episode 6 by itself is the best episode of tv I‚Äôve seen so far."

the-friend-2024,ianboolocklock,7,"#NYFF62 Film #6If you‚Äôre a dog lover, THE FRIEND is the movie for you. I‚Äôm not a pet owner but I found it to be a poignant look at a woman grieving while taking care of her friend‚Äôs dog. While I did enjoy Naomi Watts, it‚Äôs Bing the dog who is the standout of this story. He‚Äôs such a cute dog who gives one of the best performances by an animal so far. It‚Äôs also a great NY movie‚Ä¶"
no-other-land,ianboolocklock,9,"#NYFF62 Film #5I don't have much words to say. All I can say is see NO OTHER LAND. Its the most important documentary I've seen this year.

The only thing I hope can happen is more people can watch this documentary and tell the world that this war is wrong. Fingers cross that the war will end and Palestine and Israel will‚Ä¶"
apocalypse-in-the-tropics,ianboolocklock,8,"#NYFF62 Film #4APOCALYPSE IN THE TROPICS is Petra Costa‚Äôs documentary about the rise of right-wing extremism and why church and state should be separate. The whole documentary is like I was watching Brazil‚Äôs version of the Trump administration and how it mimics what went on in America. The way it ends almost reminds me of the right wing extremism‚Äôs attack on the US capitol. It‚Äôs scary times but shows why countries like Brazil are so divided.¬†If you liked Costa‚Äôs previous documentary, The Edge of Democracy, this is a great follow up to that."
the-brutalist,ianboolocklock,8,"#NYFF62 Film #1So my rating of THE BRUTALIST is more of a placeholder for now after one viewing. I think I need to see the movie a second time to see if I got all of it. If there‚Äôs one word to describe this movie is it‚Äôs epic. It‚Äôs a lot of things. The movie is about brutalism, the American Dream, being an immigrant and the journey of a creator. What people are saying about this movie is true.‚Ä¶"
dahomey,ianboolocklock,9,#NYFF62 Film #2Only 67 min long and not any of it was wasted. DAHOMEY documents the return of 26 royal treasures from France to Benin. I would describe this as a visually stunning documentary about art curation and the meaning of how art impacts a nation which is Dahomey aka Benin. üáßüáØ I like how it uses voiceover and the visual language to educate the viewer about the importance of those treasures. If you‚Äôre a fan of documentaries this is a must see.
speak-no-evil-2024,ianboolocklock,7,"If you're going to remake one of the better international horror films in this decade, you better do enough to stand on your own. Thankfully this American remake of SPEAK NO EVIL does keep the same uncomfortable nature of the original. What it does well is make this story easy to digest for American audiences. I know for me I was skeptical on having a remake come out so soon after the original 2022 film disturbed me so much.It's‚Ä¶"
fancy-dance-2023,ianboolocklock,8,"The final minutes of FANCY DANCE will destroy you if you're in the indigenous community. While the kidnapping plot was the weakest aspect, its Lily Gladstone's performance that make this movie worth checking out. She's no fluke and this proves that she's here to stay as a major talent. In fact, this would work as a nice companion if you enjoyed the series Reservation Dogs. Both do a good job at portraying the indigenous community and making their stories feel seen while making them accessible."
love-lies-bleeding-2024,ianboolocklock,8,"You can call this style over substance. However, LOVE LIES BLEEDING has so much style that the substance is enough to keep it from falling apart. This is how you do a well executed revenge film. I could never look at a female bodybuilder the same way again thanks to Katy O‚ÄôBrian. Her chemistry with Kristen Stewart is üî•."
sasquatch-sunset,ianboolocklock,7,"Well put me in the group that found SASQUATCH SUNSET a good movie. I say if this didn‚Äôt work for you, I can understand why. It billed itself as a look in the lives of Sasquatch's in a year. I respect the Zellner Bros for creating something this ambitious and fascinating for a film that relies on body language, grunts and bodily fluids.¬†For me, I found it to be not boring but one of the more memorable movies I‚Äôve seen in 2024. I could never look at a Sasquatch the same way again after witnessing this movie."
rising-phoenix,ianboolocklock,8,Well I wanted to watch a movie about Paralympians since the Summer Paralympics in Paris start this week. RISING PHOENIX is an appropriate title. It felt right since this is an inspirational documentary about athletes that doesn't let their disability bring them down. In fact these people are an example of how you rise through the hardship of being disabled and having it become a way of restarting your life again. Stuff like the Paralympics are important to these athletes.‚Ä¶
alien-romulus,ianboolocklock,8,"So my rating on ALIEN ROMULUS is based on my enjoyment as a horror movie. As a horror movie it delivers. I know it has the same foundation and structure as that classic movie from 1979. However, it works because its execution is very good. Xenomorphs and that final creature are terrifying.¬†Would I watch this again, yes. I might see this along with the 1979 film being films I can watch during spooky season."
fantastic-four,ianboolocklock,1,"I don‚Äôt know why I gave this 2 stars the first time I saw it back in 2015. My goodness, Josh Trank‚Äôs version of FANTASTIC FOUR is how you do a reboot in a bad way. If you‚Äôre not going to refer to the comics as context, then what was the point of rebooting. It‚Äôs like I was watching a movie without any context or anything redeeming qualities. It‚Äôs so boring and empty. The best superhero movies I would consider fun and entertaining. This is trying to be a more grounded superhero movie but without the fun."
the-boys-in-the-boat,ianboolocklock,6,I know George Clooney can direct. I just don‚Äôt know if THE BOYS IN THE BOAT is a story that can rise above the cliches found in other inspiring sports movies. At least this felt right to watch while the Paris 2024 Olympics are going on. I never knew much about this rowing team but at least it was engaging enough to make it a nice rainy day movie.
the-redeem-team,ianboolocklock,6,"This just felt so appropriate to watch during the current 2024 Paris Olympic Games. While the filmmaking did feel average, I did appreciate seeing why Team USA basketball needed a reset after the 2004 Summer Olympics. I could even see how other international teams are not fearing Team USA as a dominating team. Also, the best part about this documentary is seeing why a college coach like Coach K (Mike Krzyzewski) was chosen to coach. It showed that his coaching‚Ä¶"
deadpool-wolverine,ianboolocklock,8,"While DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE isn't going to be the game-changer the MCU needs, this brought me back to why I love superhero movies. Sure the plot is messy, but I don't go into a Deadpool movie expecting a compelling narrative. I go into one laughing my ass off and having fun with the characters. While this movie does get a little overstuffed, I had a blast. If you're a fan of the Fox Marvel movies, you won't be disappointed. I'm glad‚Ä¶"
deadpool-2,ianboolocklock,8,"So surprised that this viewing of DEADPOOL 2 is a first time watch for me. Yet, while it‚Äôs not as good as its predecessor, I still had fun.¬†What it suffered from that made that first film so great is the quips and meta humor isn‚Äôt as funny. It took itself maybe a little too seriously but for a good reason.¬†However, I did enjoy the new characters with Cable and Domino being the highlights. If Josh Brolin comes back‚Ä¶"

twisters,ianboolocklock,7,"Out of all the movies to get legacy sequels or reimagining of a beloved blockbuster, I didn't expect to have one for TWISTER. TWISTERS for the most part follows the same blueprint from the previous film. Yet it felt more modern with updated science and tech. I didn't expect it to lean more into the serious than the cheesy fun blockbuster. For the most part I did enjoy this. It's not as good as that 1996 summer classic. Daisy Edgar-Jones‚Ä¶"
twister,ianboolocklock,8,"You know that quote, ""it's not what a movie is about, its how it's about it."" TWISTER is a great example of a movie that emphasizes that quote. Revisiting it years later after not seeing it in so long, I had a good time. Yes the characters are thin and don't have much emotional investment. The love story is the weakest aspect. However, it's the fun spectacle of seeing storm chasers in action is why it still holds up. I believe Lee Isaac Chung will do a good job with Twisters since it looks like a fun legacy sequel."
ultraman-rising,ianboolocklock,8,"I think I‚Äôm a fan of big tokusatsu action after watching ULTRAMAN: RISING. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be an all English language animated film due to its Japanese roots. In fact, this is one of the first things I‚Äôve seen in full that embraces the Ultraman character.

As someone that didn‚Äôt like the first 47 Meters Down movie, I thought the change of setting was a big positive. I like that they get out of the cage and into a claustrophobic underwater cave.¬†Unfortunately it had some awful CGI with some bad use of green screen. Some of the underwater dark scenes look like they‚Äôre shot with fake looking water. The sharks look laughable and not scary."
street-fighter,ianboolocklock,3,"You know what made STREET FIGHTER worth watching, Raul Julia. He knew the assignment and made his version of M. Bison so memorable. It made me appreciate that he knew the game and how over-the-top Bison is. As for everyone else, this is not what I consider a ""street fighter"" movie.I'm a fan of the games, and this is one example of how you do not adapt a popular fighting game."
hundreds-of-beavers,ianboolocklock,9,"You know that feeling you get when you see a movie so special that you need to let people know how good it is. That's how I can describe the insane movie known as HUNDREDS OF BEAVERS. While it is a live action cartoon at an hour a 48 min, this movie does the one key thing right which is make you laugh.

lessons-in-chemistry,ianboolocklock,7,"I know that Brie Larson is getting most of the attention for LESSONS IN CHEMISTRY. She deserves all the praise since she's great in this eight-episode limited series. For me, the best performance is between Lewis Pullman and Aja Naomi King. I hope those two performances won't go unnoticed during the Emmys, as they do as good of a job as Brie does.The only criticism I have is that it does get too heavy-handed with the feminism. Some will find it too preachy, which is a fair critique. Anyway, this was an enjoyable limited series if you like science and female-driven stories."

shogun-2024,ianboolocklock,8,"I think I should've binge-watched SHOGUN instead of spreading out the episodes. I love Japanese history, and this felt like a fascinating lesson on the Japanese shogunate. I noticed that in the second half, it wasn't as engaging as the first half. I found myself drifting in and out due to the slower pacing. However, if you're planning to watch this 10-episode season, I recommend it for the performances and the epic scale. It truly feels like a story crafted for TV; I don't think it would work as a feature-length film."""
run-lola-run,ianboolocklock,10,"How is this movie still exhilarating and awesome 25 years later? RUN LOLA RUN is the reason why I fell in love with international cinema.

I grew up watching Nickelodeon and hearing what happened behind the scenes is devastating. I will admit this series did feel one sided and a little manipulative with its presentation.

I love how his character starts as a normal, loner guy. Then, as he becomes a fake hitman, he makes his job look easy and fun. It's a character study mixed with a light rom-com.

planet-of-the-apes,ianboolocklock,8,Those 4 stars are for its payoff. The first PLANET OF THE APES movie that started it all is a great start. It can take awhile for the plot to get going.

rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver,ianboolocklock,2,Well I‚Äôm glad I saw this. I was curious on how part 2 of REBEL MOON would conclude Zack Snyder‚Äôs take on Seven Samurai.

This just doesn‚Äôt cut it and I‚Äôm not sure if an ultimate cut can fix this two part movie.
birth-2004,ianboolocklock,7,BIRTH should go in the pile of movies that critics didn't understand. I'm shocked that this movie by Jonathan Glazer has a 39% RT score. I think its way better than what that score indicates. Sure the story can get a little muddled in the final minutes.

rebel-moon-part-one-a-child-of-fire,ianboolocklock,4,"Fingers crossed that the longer directors cut is better than what was shown here. REBEL MOON (part 1) is what I call a dull derivative space opera. You can tell Zack Snyder is a fan of Kurosawa since this plot was inspired by Seven Samurai. While there is some fun action and cool visuals, it‚Äôs missing something big, compelling characters. They‚Äôre not that interesting or engaging to keep me interested from what‚Äôs going on.You know what did this Kurosawa inspired story better, The Magnificent Seven.

PERFECT DAYS just sums up why life's little moments matter as you get old. This movie follows a public city janitor day by day and doesn't feel stale throughout the 2 hour runtime. Who would've thought seeing a guy clean bathrooms, take pictures of nature and listen to classic rock on tape can be so engaging and moving.‚Ä¶"
ninety-five-senses,ianboolocklock,8,I hope this will be the one that gives the director of Napoleon Dynamite an Academy Award. I didn't expect NINETY-FIVE SENSES to be a reflective piece on someone's life involving the five senses. The best thing about this is the different animation styles for each of the five senses. Its so creative and shows why animation is a great medium for a story like this.
kung-fu-panda,ianboolocklock,7,"Well, it was fun to revisit how a panda named Po became the KUNG FU PANDA. For a film released in 2008, I'm impressed by how well the animation held up. The best stuff is anything with the Furious Five. They should have their own spin-off series since they were fun characters. The humor is hit or miss for me. However, when it's used in the fight scenes, its really funny."

we-grown-now,ianboolocklock,7,"Other than some pacing issues that made the movie feel longer than 90 minutes, WE GROWN NOW is a very solid coming of age film about a friendship. These two boys played by Blake Cameron James and Gian Knight Ramirez could be two actors to watch for best child performances of 2024 so far. Their friendship felt so genuine with the backdrop of the Cabrini-Green housing complex brings it back to what the 90s was like in lower class Chicago.

willy-wonka-the-chocolate-factory,ianboolocklock,8,"So it‚Äôs been a long time since I last watched WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. I actually read the book as a kid before seeing the movie.¬†Watching it now as an adult, I still had a good time. Yet this did have a vibe where Willy Wonka is a madman and what happens to the kids is when you mess around in his factory. The songs are still great and I still love Gene Wilder as Wonka.¬†I don‚Äôt know if this is a childhood favorite I would go back to that often. It‚Äôs still a fun movie that‚Äôs still nostalgic for me."
wonka,ianboolocklock,7,"The one thing I forgot to do while watching WONKA was, eating some chocolate. This movie works better as a reminder of why Willy Wonka and the whimsical world of his candy making feels so nostalgic. It brought me back to a time as a kid where I just want to go to a candy store and eat the best candy I can find. I actually liked Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka. He's charming and looks like he's having fun‚Ä¶"
nai-nai-wai-po,ianboolocklock,9,"Wow, this was so touching. Watching these two grandmas remind me of my parents as they‚Äôre getting older. I like how both of these grandmas are not afraid of death. They‚Äôre just living life to the fullest as they know they‚Äôre at the age where death is coming. This doc short is so sad but also uplifting because it had some scenes that made me laugh.¬†A good start for me so far in catching up with the best documentary short nominees for this Oscar season."
the-greatest-night-in-pop,ianboolocklock,8,Now I see why recording a song late at night is so exhausting. For a lot of these artists this was a once in a lifetime opportunity to record a song with some of your peers that you respect. I don‚Äôt think this doc about the recording of ‚ÄúWe Are The World‚Äù needs to be longer than its runtime of 96 minutes. My favorite moments is hearing Springsteen belt those tough high notes. Also great to see how Lionel Richie‚Ä¶
this-is-menow,ianboolocklock,7,"So I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of J.Lo‚Äôs music. However, this was a fun vanity piece that had some fun choreography and a nice narrative. It‚Äôs basically the love life of Jennifer Lopez and how she manages to go in and out of love. I do like a lot of the songs since this was made to be a visual representation of her latest album.¬†Maybe my therapist needs to be Fat Joe. He was the best part of this."
somebody-i-used-to-know,ianboolocklock,7,Now I need to reconnect with people from my past after watching SOMEBODY I USED TO KNOW. This movie reminded me of what I love about being at home with family and catching up with people you haven't seen in a very long time. It's also about reflecting on choices you made and if those choices were the right ones. Granted this is a dramedy with some decent laughs. I watched this basically for Alison Brie and I enjoyed her‚Ä¶
dicks-the-musical,ianboolocklock,2,"Ugh, just not funny at all. I think I only laughed once but it wasn‚Äôt a gut busting laugh. It‚Äôs all a bunch of nothing if you‚Äôre relying on the same shock humor throughout the short runtime. Even the songs are forgettable except for maybe the last song. DICKS THE MUSICAL was just not for me."
the-marvels,ianboolocklock,5,"I have to admit, I did have some fun watching THE MARVELS. The biggest problem for me is that two movies in and I feel like Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel is just not an interesting Marvel superhero. She's just one note and doesn't have the characterization to make me care for her journey in the MCU. The other two (Ms. Marvel and Monica Rambeau) I felt like I knew them much better and were more interesting because they came‚Ä¶"
all-dirt-roads-taste-of-salt,ianboolocklock,7,"So I was really vibing with the first half of ALL DIRT ROADS TASTE OF SALT. From the opening shot, I was mesmerized by its visuals. It‚Äôs like watching a visual art display that got me glued to the screen. The story is small which makes sense for its visuals. Unfortunately, the glacial pacing and repetitiveness did lose me in the second half. Like I get what Raven Jackson was going for. I just found myself detached since I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶"
upon-entry,ianboolocklock,8,"So I've been so behind on watching Spirit Awards nominated movies, I'm just glad I found one that is the hidden gem of the nominees. UPON ENTRY is an example of how you use great pacing in a short runtime of 77 minutes. For a film about two immigrants trying to gain entry into the United States, this was so engaging from beginning to end. I like how as the story unfolds you're not exactly sure how the two lead‚Ä¶"
whore,ianboolocklock,2,"Who would've thought a movie about a WHORE can be so boring. I think the script would work better on stage than in film since its based on a play. This just felt like watching a boring tame cartoon, that made me think why is this movie rated NC-17. The way it ended was just laughably bad. If I wanted a more gritty look at prostitution, I would rather watch a documentary instead of this movie."
whether-the-weather-is-fine,ianboolocklock,7,"So I don't watch many films from my parent's country. I will admit, that Filipino cinema is still a mystery to me. If I find one that I know I'm gonna enjoy, it's movies similar to WHETHER THE WEATHER IS FINE. This is more of a look at the three characters and their reaction to how they'll live life after the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan. The only negative I have is the movie is an hour and 44 minutes and‚Ä¶"
the-curse-2023,ianboolocklock,8,"Ummm. I have no clue what I just watched. THE CURSE should be at the minimum a 2 season series. After what I just watched in the first season, it didn't feel like the story was completed. At first, I wasn't on its wavelength because I wasn't a fan of its slow pacing throughout. Part of it felt like a snoozer at times. As soon as I got to know the three main characters a lot more, that's when it‚Ä¶"
20-days-in-mariupol,ianboolocklock,8,I hope all the people that left Mariupol are safe and doing well. Watching what I saw in 20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL is heartbreaking. üíî I‚Äôm so sorry to all the Ukrainians that are still dealing with this awful war with Russia. This might be a one and done viewing but it‚Äôs a very good one at a look at propaganda war journalism.
society-of-the-snow,ianboolocklock,9,If there's one word I can describe SOCIETY OF THE SNOW is tragic. This is a tragic story about survival while also giving respect to the survivors and people that died during the plane crash of Uruguayan Air Force flight 571. Its amazing to see how real this movie put you in the shoes of those people in the plane. Once the plane crashed on the mountain I was clenching my fists and felt so heartbroken. I didn't mind that‚Ä¶
sound-of-freedom,ianboolocklock,5,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   If your film ends with a PSA about the subject matter portrayed in this movie, it comes off as preachy. Sure SOUND OF FREEDOM is a well-made thriller about a real person dedicated to his job. I just don't know if this was the right approach to make me care. It felt so heavy-handed and got less engaging as it went along. I hope to find better movies that portray the subject matter of child sex trafficking in a way‚Ä¶"
kokomo-city,ianboolocklock,8,"What a fascinating look at the transgender sex worker experience. What I love about KOKOMO CITY is that each of these women is doing this to get by and find a better life. The movie doesn't shame them for what they're doing. At only 72 minutes, it's nice and short. I knew each of these women very well throughout the short runtime. Also, a great soundtrack to accompany the intimate black & white cinematography."
evil-dead-rise,ianboolocklock,7,"EVIL DEAD RISE proves that the Evil Dead franchise is still a fun horror series. It has everything I wanted in an Evil Dead movie. It has the gore, the gruesome violence, and terrifying imagery. While the story does feel familiar, I like that this was a back to basics story. You know what I mean, someone finds the book of the dead, reads it and bad things happen. That's all that it needs to be and it worked because the horror still feel fresh. I can never look at a cheese grater again after how its used here."
65,ianboolocklock,2,"I usually do this tradition where I watch a bad movie from the previous year to start off the new year. I chose 65 and yep, this film is boring. All that this movie is Adam Driver doing a space mission and crash lands on a dinosaur planet trying to survive. That's it and it's not fun or thrilling to keep my attention. Hey at least the dinosaur CGI looked cool."
shin-kamen-rider,ianboolocklock,8,"Now I hope to watch more tokusatsu/kaiju and anime movies in 2024. I'm glad to start the year off with this one. SHIN KAMEN RIDER (Shin Masked Rider) is the latest film in the Shin-Japan Heroes Universe. As someone who knows Kamen Rider through watching Super Sentai, this was a lot of fun. I've never seen a full Kamen Rider series in full. This was a nice introduction to the famous Japanese toku hero. Love the suit and action. I‚Ä¶"
talk-to-me-2022,ianboolocklock,8,"Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna play talk to the hand for a while after watching TALK TO ME. This is how you do a horror movie in my eyes. It's a disturbing, freaky, and yet very moving film that got me emotional at times. This doesn't feel like the A24 horror movie I'm used to that arthouse audiences will love over the mainstream. Yet, now I see why it did so well for mainstream audiences. If you give me good relatable characters with a concept that keeps me engaged, you have a successful formula for a horror movie. Love this one."
taylor-swift-reputation-stadium-tour,ianboolocklock,9,"I‚Äôm more of a casual Taylor Swift fan. This concert made me feel like I was there. What this show does well is showcase that her music does connect with a lot of people. I do think ‚Äúreputation‚Äù is her most under appreciated album in her discography. As a fan of that album, I‚Äôm glad to see a good majority of the songs were on the setlist.¬†This ‚Äúreputation‚Äù stadium tour show feels like a taste of what she would do with the ‚Äúeras‚Äù tour. Now I want to go back to a concert in the new year."
high-noon,ianboolocklock,8,"HIGH NOON at the end of the day is more of a white knuckle thriller than a western. Yet the use of the real time aspect makes this one a thrilling film. At only 85 minutes, this movie moves where no scene feels wasted. Once you get to the thrilling shootout, it‚Äôs a satisfying payoff. This is a movie that‚Äôs about its editing in a very simple story."
the-dragon-lives-again,matth,10,Dude I would be so scared if Bruce Lee and Popeye teamed up to beat my ass.

malice,matth,8,"One the most ridiculous movies of all time, taken 100% seriously by everyone involved (Gordon Willis giving this his trademark prince of darkness look lmao) except for Alec Baldwin who plays it with the perfect mischievous twinkle in his eye that proves he is simply the greatest actor to ever live."

planes-trains-and-automobiles,zackpaslay,,"Be nice to customer service employees, kids! Especially during the holidays!"
wings,zackpaslay,,Incredibly tender performance from Charles ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Rogers (who I fell in love with the second he appeared onscreen). That final scene between Jack and David‚Ä¶ WOW. It‚Äôs insane what technical feats are pulled off in this film.
gladiator-2000,zackpaslay,,"Solid entry in the Movies for Dads Canon. Accidentally dozed off a little during The Spaniard‚Äôs ascent, but woke back up when Maximus and Commodus were reunited, and the rest of the film really kept my attention. Really loved watching Commodus lose his mind over how Maximus could only be beloved. The monologue about virtue near the beginning is both heartbreaking and the most ‚ÄúJeez, this guy is pathetic‚Äù shit I‚Äôve seen in awhile."
birth-2004,zackpaslay,,"Haunted by this. A dissertation on the everlasting effects of grief - the hope that never completely dies and the hoops we jump through to justify said hope. Nicole, in her Mia Farrow cut, is haunted and haunting. Cameron Bright is a blank canvas, able to see through the viewer. That final scene in the bathroom is so difficult, uncomfortable and perplexing, leaving one distraught. Loved viewing this with the wonderful Chicago Film Society and going out for drinks with friends afterwards."

wicked-2024,zackpaslay,,"Let me get my gripes out first because I did genuinely enjoy this - the backlighting and cinematography generally do such a disservice to the beautiful sets, costumes, and performances. This could‚Äôve been the best looking film of the year and it gets in its own way, and that‚Äôs disappointing. The edit could‚Äôve used another pass as well.With that, I really liked it!

What joy there is in abandoning that which doesn‚Äôt matter, so simple yet so difficult. The illumination of life, finding truth through blue light and carefully placed snow, letting a deer run into frame at the perfect moment. Falling and spinning, sinking into one another, all in glorious Technicolor. Romance has rarely been so encompassing."
thelma-2024,zackpaslay,,"A lot more reflective than I was expecting, really tapped into the horror of losing autonomy. Very funny in many sections as well. Squibb is incredible - really wonderful to watch as both a comedic and dramatic actress. Screamed at one very specific cameo."
a-real-pain,zackpaslay,,"Everything reminds me of her (the her in question is¬†Old Joy, dir. Kelly Reichardt)! Great showcase for Kieran Culkin, who weaves the wirey thread of his character so masterfully. Eisenberg also gets a fantastic monologue in the middle of this. Loved seeing Jennifer Grey!"
the-heartbreak-kid-1972,zackpaslay,,"Charles Grodin is perfectly scummy, Cybil Shepard is perfectly charming in this sort-of meta role, and Jeannie Berlin is plain perfection - a comic force.

moonstruck,zackpaslay,,"beautiful and impulsive. everything is romantic, right?"
hangover-square,zackpaslay,,"Incredible ending. This thing just looms, anchored in obsession and confusion, completely oblivious to the outside world. That George scores his own demise is uniquely tragic, as his world burns - the world of his own unaware making. It's deeply sad that Laird Cregar passed two months before this was released, he delivers such a wonderful performance in this."
blitz-2024,zackpaslay,,"very handsomely-made film that's surprisingly restrained emotionally for McQueen. Saoirse is great, but overall, this didn't offer much that felt fresh to me. after so many twists and turns, amidst all of the bombs and the chaos, one hopes to feel something for the characters, but by the final shot, it rang a little hollow for me. McQueen is an excellent filmmaker, which makes this film's lack of affectivity that much more disappointing"

the-nutcracker-1993,zackpaslay,,"Was deeply curious about this given its year of release, budget, and being Emile Ardolino's final theatrically released film. At the end of the day, it's just a live-capture of the New York City Ballet's production of The Nutcracker (featuring Macauley Culkin because it's 1993), but that's not a completely bad thing. Culkin never seems fully comfortable amidst all of the pageantry, but the film does still deliver that pageantry in full force. Is it as exciting as watching the‚Ä¶"

conclave,zackpaslay,,"Genuinely taken aback by how much I loved this. A chamber drama of a highly melodramatic caliber, with loud whispers, taboo, and political commentary loudly onscreen. It‚Äôs on-the-nose on purpose, just like Sirk liked it. Whole cast delivers, with enough walk-and-talks to make Sorkin say, ‚ÄúHey, maybe I should write something interesting again.‚Äù Who knew the papacy could be so petty? Kinda makes me wanna watch America‚Äôs Next Top Model"
we-live-in-time,zackpaslay,,"Very charmed by Florence and Andrew in this. I appreciate the swing of doing a non-linear narrative, I just don‚Äôt know that it completely works for me here. Gas station scene was excellent! I really wish I felt more emotionally invested in the characters, though again, the two actors are doing very well with the material. Not a bad film in any capacity, I just wish I‚Äôd felt more compelled by it."

anora,zackpaslay,,"I remember at one point during press for The Florida Project, Sean Baker said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably never have a budget over $1mil, I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with it.‚Äù Cut to seven years later, Baker‚Äôs Anora utilizes his unique sensibilities in terms of character and humor (this might be the closest thing to a screwball comedy I‚Äôve seen in years) while expanding the scope in terms of location, movement, and image. Mikey Madison is unstoppable, clinging to Anora‚Äôs perseverance and headstrong nature for dear life, maintained by Baker‚Äôs absolute desire for authenticity. Loved it!"
over-the-garden-wall-2014,zackpaslay,,"Rewatched in preparation for our special members screening of this at the Music Box on November 6th! Such a lovely send-up of early animation and the ordeal that is being a teenager in touch with his feelings. Also, Greg is the best!! And that‚Äôs a rock fact!"

fiesta,zackpaslay,,"Ricardo Montalban gives a fantastic debut performance here. The film itself is fine, but Montalban dances, fights, and charms with gusto, bursting into the film with the vitality of a new star commanding the screen. His two dances with Cyd Charisse are an absolute knockout!"
vox-lux,zackpaslay,,"Fame and violence in the 21st century. Completely understandable that this would be divisive, but I found it to be such a rich dissection of America‚Äôs obsession with spectacle and celebrity in a post-9/11 world. Celeste‚Äôs descent into lacking personhood or self-awareness rings true knowing that she survived the opening tragedy as well as the tragedies of being a woman in the public eye in the mid-00s. Does it make her good? No, but it explains her actions.I know Natalie Portman kills ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Get You Out of My Head‚Äù when she goes to karaoke."

It‚Äôs crazy to think about everything that‚Äôs happened in those two years, especially considering how much more at peace I am now than I was then.

saturday-night-2024,zackpaslay,,some great moments mixed with some baffling choices. the jim henson characterization??? not how i would‚Äôve approached that! thought most of the cast was great tho! first 20 minutes and all of its whip pans made me slightly nauseated. weird to see a movie be like ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live was anti-establishment and revolutionary‚Äù when it‚Äôs been The Establishment for most (if not all) of my life. dylan o‚Äôbrien hot.
lady-in-the-water,zackpaslay,,"Drifted in and out of this during our late late showing - the dreamlike state of this movie honestly lends itself to it. Felt very compelled by how community-centric the whole film feels. Story almost acts as Dorothy, lost in a foreign world looking to go home, and the apartment complex acts as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, Wizard, and Ozians all rolled into one. idk I‚Äôm very sleepy and I felt Shyamalan‚Äôs wonder seep through as I was drifting in and out and I liked it!"

megalopolis-2024,zackpaslay,,"Look, it held my attention, and it‚Äôs incredibly ambitious, and it‚Äôs nice to see something about the future that, in the end, rebukes dystopia. It‚Äôs incoherent at times, sure, but idk I was taken with it - excess in its purest state. At one point, Adam Driver looks like Rihanna in the ‚ÄúDisturbia‚Äù video. Aubrey Plaza is genuinely excellent, and I just think Kathryn Hunter should be in everything."
the-wild-robot,zackpaslay,,"Really, really lovely. Lupita (unsurprisingly) gives my favorite voice performance of the year so far. The compositions in this are insanely good, with some really fun camera movements and use of perspective. It‚Äôs lovely to see Chris Sanders cooking like this again, really leaning into themes of community care and found family (which he‚Äôs great at)! Would love to see this really take off with the family audience!"
a-different-man,zackpaslay,,"Sebastian Stan does good work here, but the film really comes alive once Adam Pearson enters (which is probably the point). Really fun to watch Sebastian unravel as Pearson just keeps having more and more fun, really leaning into the self-hatred and unrelenting jealousy that Edward/Guy feels."
frank-capra-mr-america,zackpaslay,,"Fairly standard doc with a nuanced, mostly appreciative look at Capra that ties his career to the flaws of The American Dream. Dives into some of the cognitive dissonance of his films and his personal political beliefs as well as the problematic nature of the ‚Äúself-made man‚Äù narrative he spinned about himself. Loved seeing Farran Smith Nehme and Sam Wasson as talking heads! They spelled Farran‚Äôs name wrong when they first flashed her name though! Shameful!"
lilies,zackpaslay,,"Masterful play-to-film adaptation, rich with its world-building and its oscillation between the real world and the theatrical. Can't even begin to dive into how powerful the performances are here - yearning, tragedy, naivety, romance, hope, mourning. The whole cast is fantastic, especially Danny Gilmore and Alexander Chapman. Truly wonderful film, a diamond in the Queer canon."
invasion-of-the-body-snatchers,zackpaslay,,"The moment he realizes that he's been hearing a radio from afar instead of actual human singing... heartbreaking! There's an underlying dread to this whole film that just rules, really emphasizing the horror of everyone around you turning cold and unfeeling. It's easy to see how many films were influenced by this - mob mentality, alien conquest, the whole nine yards. Kevin McCarthy has a great face!"

25th-hour,zackpaslay,,"Spike captures the grief, anger, betrayal, sorrow, and the pursuit of normalcy one takes after a striking blow. How quick will you be to blame someone else before you realize how much you are to blame? The five actors at the center are all magnificent, with Spike giving room for both bombast and subtlety. Insanely good ending."

matilda,zackpaslay,,"Realized recently that I'd never seen this start-to-finish. It's lovely!! Devito is clearly inspired by Terry Gilliam here, which is very fun for a family flick. Lots of wide angles and camera whips and absurdity. I looooooove that beautiful house that the Wormwoods live in. Rhea Perlman is giving ""Audrey from Little Shop if she was evil,"" and I love that for me specifically. The ""Itty Bitty Pretty One"" sequence is sooooo cool. Kids rule!"

zero-patience,zackpaslay,,"Bold, audacious storytelling with a clear vision. A bit inconsistent at times, but I have massive respect for how Greyson approaches both the satire and the central emotions of this - especially given the time in which it was made and how targeted Ga√´tan Dugan and Queer people as a whole had become. AND it‚Äôs an independent film with humorous musical numbers where the songs aren‚Äôt awful. LOVE that!"
a-letter-to-three-wives,zackpaslay,,"love the structure, love the wit, love the fashions and interiors, love Thelma Ritter stealing scenes"
powwow-highway,zackpaslay,,"‚ÄúOften the problems never change. Nor the people.‚ÄùGary Farmer gives such a joyful, layered performance here. The whole film is so in-tune with the land and its history, showcasing the beauties, humors, and tragedies. The scene where Philbert tells the story of Wihio and the plums is a knock-out, with Buddy‚Äôs cynicism and Philbert‚Äôs hope coming to a head, softly and quietly. So many great landscape shots in this too. Really hoping we see a restoration before too long - this film deserves it!"
merchant-ivory,zackpaslay,,"Very clearly appreciative of Merchant-Ivory‚Äôs productions and moxie, but also more-than-a-bit gossipy in nature. Solid but flawed retrospective. It did make me wanna watch the entire Merchant-Ivory filmography tho!"

the-rider,zackpaslay,,"Breathtaking cinematography with a devastating central performance. Feeling like you have to prove yourself amidst the unfairness of life‚Äôs parade. Zhao directs the shit out of this, pulling truly remarkable work out of the actors, the settings, her crew, and the culture. The scene in the supermarket and the scene with Apollo in the field‚Ä¶ really heartbreaking stuff."
the-holly-and-the-ivy,zackpaslay,,"Oooooooh I love holiday melancholy. Nothing like the entire family being in the same room to make long-held reservations come to the surface. Not animalistic like many ""family in one house"" movies, but rather reserved, anxious, and mournful. Margaret Leighton is marvelous!"
unbreakable,zackpaslay,,"The text at the end feels like a post-test screening addition to me, and I don't really care for it, but the ending itself? Fantastic. The use of color and lighting in this is magnificent, and Shyamalan has such a grasp on his characters and the unremarkable and fantastic world they inhabit. The compositions and the long takes are perfection as well - that first conversation on the train with David and the sports agent is so neat, like eavesdropping on people whose lives are complex, though we'll only ever know so much. Great take on the superhero origin story!"
rock-around-the-clock,zackpaslay,,"Men used to do full choreographed dance routines without a single hint of irony, bring it back!! I don‚Äôt know that this was ever going to be an amazing film, but I do wish a different director had been attached to it - some of the sequences are waaay too stiff and/or unsure of themselves. Lots of great choreography tho! Fun songs! Very silly to think of teenagers losing their absolute minds over some guy who looks like he‚Äôd play tabletop games with my dad. Cold War remains the film to best utilize ‚ÄúRock Around the Clock‚Äù."

dogfight,zackpaslay,,"The way Rose completely disarms Eddie is so captivating. The way he slowly becomes gentler, aware that his own machismo is all bullshit. In any other movie, the scene where Eddie starts all of the machines in the music room would be unsettling, but here, it‚Äôs warm and open, signifying a change in himself - still a little brash, but melodic at the core. Lily and River pair magnificently!"

Barbara gives one of the best monologues of her career. The nuclear family continues to look like a trap, with social mores appearing to be life‚Äôs biggest scam. Just as dynamic as a black-and-white film as it would‚Äôve been in color. Pair this with Old Joy!!"

the-verdict-1982,zackpaslay,,"Pretty good final 45 or so minutes. Love Newman and Mason. Thought the very end felt a little shoehorned (it gives reshoot after test screening to me). Lumet does a couple of great long shots in this, and the sort-of mid-thought cuts are an interesting tactic."
erin-brockovich,zackpaslay,,"Top-tier Julia Roberts, top-tier monologues, top-tier banter, top-tier Mom cinema. I know the Mother's Day screening of this goes CRAZY, eliciting cheers for at least two perfect moments. The color grade on this makes California look completely drab, and I think that's fun."
carousel,zackpaslay,,"Henry King is never super confident as a director here. So much of this is remarkably boring, surprising given its budget and scope. Louise‚Äôs ballet is lovely, but again, could‚Äôve benefitted from better direction. Mixed signals on the messaging too. Made me wanna visit the cape and eat a lot of seafood though. DeLuxe color photography on this looks great too (though some scenes could‚Äôve used better lighting AND DIRECTION)."
snoopy-come-home,zackpaslay,,"The Sherman Brothers did the music for this one and it SHOWS. ""Fundamental-Friend-Dependability"" started, and we started screaming. Like THAT'S how you do rhymes. The opening beach scenes are so cute!! There are dimensional camera moves in this???????? Jarring for a Peanuts affair, but cool! Not the funniest of the Peanuts movies (probably the saddest), but still very adorable."
bambi,zackpaslay,,"When was the last time y'all've watched this? This is fantastic!!!! It's been well over a decade since the last time I've seen Bambi (probably when I was a teenager going through all of Disney Animation's films), and I honed in on the pure visual splendor and invention this go-round. The backgrounds, the colors, the detail, the movement, the score, THE WATER, the intentional interplay of realism and impressionism. There's a level of artistry here that feels free - allowed‚Ä¶"

And Martha Plimpton plays a hot f*g hag!"
the-sixth-sense,zackpaslay,,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   I once had a professor who proclaimed that ""no good film can be spoiled"". I can't remember who told me and when, but I've known of this film's famous twist for a few years, so I was curious how that would affect my viewing experience. Luckily, I really enjoyed this a lot! It's really fascinating that Shyamalan pretty much thought, ""Hey, what if Ordinary People was a ghost story?"" Haley and Toni's chemistry is so good - both able to‚Ä¶"
sing-sing-2023,zackpaslay,,"Life-affirming - a beautiful, nuanced portrait of what it means to regain your humanity under circumstances that would make any other feel trapped. The ensemble here is incredible, bouncing off of each other through play, empathy, and vulnerability. As each character opens up, their confined space opens wider and wider, as if the whole world is possible. Colman Domingo is one of our greatest working actors, never stealing a scene but ebbing and flowing in each scene magnificently."
a-boy-named-charlie-brown,zackpaslay,,"I know Lucy is a capitalist because she and her girls keep treating Charlie Brown with such contempt that he develops new neuroses never before experienced by man, keeping her corrupt psychiatric practice in business. smh üòïPsychedelic sequences cool as hell in this!!!!!!!!! Schroeder calls Charlie Brown ‚Äúcute‚Äù!!!!!! Snoopy ice skates!!!!!!"
romeo-juliet-1996,zackpaslay,,"On paper, Moulin Rouge! is the kind of film that should be completely up my alley - a big, boisterous original movie musical with a clear directorial vision and flamboyant musical numbers. And while I respect that film and Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs clear and creative vision, it‚Äôs a film I have a hard time loving. Color me surprised then that I absolutely loved this - a maximalist adaptation of Shakespeare‚Äôs text played to the very, very back row with caricatured aesthetics‚Ä¶"
scorpio-rising,zackpaslay,,Blessed be the leather daddy. Let‚Äôs ride!
the-music-man,zackpaslay,,"A curious little film. Was this already dated when it came out in 1962? Feels like it would be, but it‚Äôs still pre-Poppins/Fair Lady/TSOM, so maybe not. Parts of this work VERY well for me. Parts of this do not. It‚Äôs very clear that DaCosta is more of a theatre director, which plays in his favor sometimes and hinders him others. Robert Preston is excellent! The dancing is very often genuinely fantastic! 7-year old Ronny Howard is pitchy!"
long-days-journey-into-night,zackpaslay,,"Raw to a point of discomfort. The writing is so rich as it reveals all four characters whether through clear lies or vulnerable truths. The resentments, the secrets, the overwhelming baggage that‚Äôs so dusty as to almost be unrecognizable. Kate is the obvious stand-out, but seeing Ralph Richardson and Jason Robards go head-to-head - clearly drawing from different acting techniques - is thrilling. And Dean Stockwell‚Äôs good looks make his ‚Äúperfect son‚Äù character all the more poignant, allowing him to be both his own man and the outlet each family member needs. Lumet mostly keeps this behemoth afloat, including an absolute home-run of a final shot."
pickpocket,zackpaslay,,"Martin LaSalle has a perfect face for this. He rarely changes expression, but he‚Äôs able to emit such guilt, looking like a child who just told a fib. His inner world is so clear with the slightest move. The way pickpocketing is depicted in this movie is not unlike how cruising is depicted in other movies. I will not be expounding on that at this time, but it is very sensual and I love it!"

I got to see these colors and textures I‚Äôd only ever seen in movies and pictures and Looney Tunes cartoons.

mystic-pizza,zackpaslay,,"SO charming! Prime ‚ÄúMake It a Blockbuster Night‚Äù Cinema. Julia is perfect of course (the pool scene?????? perfection!), and this film also serves as a reminder to treasure one of our most underrated actresses, Lili Taylor. Conchata Ferrell was giving her line readings as if she‚Äôs got a killer rendition of ‚ÄúRose‚Äôs Turn‚Äù in her cabaret set, which I loved. How on-the-nose would it be to double bill this with Waitress? Probably very, but I‚Äôd watch that! Let me look up pizza places as I head home, I‚Äôm hungry."

high-and-low,zackpaslay,,You can tell Kurosawa was PUMPED about widescreen ‚Äòcause the way he fills the image here is insaaaaaanely good. A mystery in two parts - protecting property instead of people and ending with a refusal to make a spectacle out of lifelong poverty. The curtain‚Äôs closed. Don‚Äôt make eye contact.
sideways,zackpaslay,,"The DVD that suddenly appeared on the shelf of every middle-aged middle-class white person you knew in 2005. How did Paul not get nominated for this?? Truly such a layered, textured portrayal of melancholy - the fear of letting go of that thing you hyperfixate on because you have to be human for a little while. Made me want a glass of wine real bad! Gas used to be $1.74 a gallon!"
the-breaking-point,zackpaslay,,"Brilliant cast. The way the narrative builds tension is just exquisite, able to weave post-war anxieties with domestic and crime melodramas. One sees John Garfield become less-and-less human, holding out hope that he‚Äôll see the light until it‚Äôs just too late. That final shot is unreal - heartbreaking and devastating and bleak."
the-manchurian-candidate,zackpaslay,,"Frankenheimer‚Äôs portrait of Communist hysteria is startling, captivating, and pulse-pounding. The whole cast delivers, but Angela Lansbury is especially arresting. Releasing this in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis is CRAZY. Incredible ending!"

the-firm-1993,jmckerchar,6,"This was incredibly stupid, dry, and generic for the most part, but there were some classic Tom Cruise thrills too. If you're looking for good Tom Cruise running scenes, go no further. But I certainly expected better from Sydney Pollack with Tom Cruise, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris, and Holly Hunter... just to name a few."
transformers-one,jmckerchar,7,Lowkey makes me want to watch some Transformers even though I didn't really care for the franchise as a kid. I might have if something this good and this popular was out.
gladiator-2000,jmckerchar,8,"This gets a little slow at times, but Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs performances are more than enough to make up for that. I‚Äôm excited to go see the second movie tomorrow, even though my two favorite parts of the first one won‚Äôt be in it."
girl-interrupted,jmckerchar,7,"I like a lot of things about this movie, but the technical aspects were just so boring. Obviously it was dealing with some very serious themes, but the way it was presented felt like something I would have been shown in elementary school. This was definitely a mixed bag for me overall."
rmn,jmckerchar,7,"This film is not all that magnificent in its presentation, but I really enjoyed the way it explored ethnic tensions on the scale of just a single town. I can't imagine that's not exactly how it looks right now in a lot of Romanian towns. Ethnic nationalism in a lot of those Eastern European countries is probably an even bigger issue than here in the United States too."

maxxxine,jmckerchar,6,"My rating might be a little generous considering what I got out of the movie, but the production was pretty good and it was entertaining overall. Certainly the weakest of the trilogy though; the plot was very stupid for the most part and the movie relied on cheap shock value a lot of the time."
dinner-in-america,jmckerchar,5,"Yeah, I guess this wasn't for me. I did not care for nor like either of the two main characters, and most of the plot was just weird to me. I guess the film's overall quality wasn't that bad, but I found this to just be strange more than anything else."
didi-2024,jmckerchar,7,This was really well done all-around. The directing stood out to me as particularly good though. I loved the style and the way it left some interpretation up to the viewer in the end.
challengers,jmckerchar,9,"This is definitely my favorite movie of the year so far. There were so many things to like about it, but I think my favorite aspect was its nonlinear plot.

the-saphead,peng,5,"Buster Keaton being a lead replacement for Douglas Fairbanks (and was recommended by Fairbanks himself after the latter was unavailable) proves his strength as an actor, with his presence a clear standout, but also how his persona can brush up against normal material. As enjoyable as it is to see Keaton operates in this mode with some of his own Keaton-esque spins (especially the climax at the stock exchange), dropping him and his character right down into this story makes the tonal whiplash between his lighter, comedy-tinged scenes and straightforward melodrama everywhere else feel rather incoherent and subtract from each other."
the-phantom-light,peng,6,"Michael Powell's early ""quota quickie"" film only has one real trace I can see to his future, more famous phase in that he will return to this kind of location times again for more in-depth community exploration/tonal usage (like The Edge of the World and I Know Where I‚Äôm Going!), but outsides of that for a developing directorial hand and a fast turnaround, he manages to keep it moving pulpy and fast-paced enough."
the-penguin-2024,peng,7,"The rare time where I feel a show should be an episode or two longer (two would round this out as ten nicely), since the arc has the kind of expansive scope and ensemble of players that make some stretches of its 8-episode run feel crammed, summarized, or skimpy. Example is the middle stretch of the finale, what with the fast ping-ponging of power gained and lost, and the mob boss stuff's turns that don't feel as satisfying as it‚Ä¶"
fly-me-to-the-moon-2024,peng,6,"This works far better as fizzy banter comedy (especially by Johansson) than any kind of space period drama/sci-fi, so the second half of inevitable focus on the latter deflates it a lot. Also, watching this now instead of in its release makes the scene of Johansson's assistant finding out she's been duped into technically working for Nixon really hit different. ""Because, Kelly, I will not work for Richard Nixon. I can't even believe he's going to be president! I had no idea I disagreed with this much of the country."""
the-scarecrow,peng,7,"A Keaton short not flowing as one story isn't necessarily a deal-breaker in term of being great, but this kinda puts the best set-piece upfront so it has a feeling of fading down instead of escalating up, even though all are at least really good and it ends on a winning one. Still, that opening bit of the house with all the multi-purpose design is such a wildly inventive, joyful one, and surely an inspiration for Tati?"
neighbors,peng,8,"Using the Romeo-Juliet template, where he and the girl from the opposite buildings want to reach each other while the rest of their families are against and hostile to the other side, Keaton orchestrates and ramps up the set-pieces of two floors of two buildings facing each other (my favorite is three people standing on top of one another going back and forth into each building) with his usual consummate yet still awe-inspiring imagination and skill."
romantic-blue,peng,6,"Only in 5th year of Suphannahong Awards, basically the Thai Oscar, the awards back then already functioned like the current Oscar, with this film pretty much a winning sweep, including Best Actress for what is to me clearly a supporting role (she's very good, but maybe has material not too different from the guy who won Supporting Actor here).

duckweed-1981,peng,6,"My first Edward Yang is his directorial debut (available thanks to the letterboxd community in the review section), so I wouldn't have known if any of this signals the director's acclaimed touches down the line.

all-is-true,peng,6,"For me, that one scene of Branagh (as Shakespeare) and McKellen (as Earl of Southampton) together for an electric, questioning, aching recitation is worth the price of admission alone."
the-symbol-of-the-unconquered,peng,6,"Some incomplete footage is detrimental to the skipping story's coherence at times, although far less than first Micheaux film I saw, Body and Soul, and regrettably (and suspiciously?) the most sustained missing sequence feels like it function as both the film's dramatic peak and narrative rebuttal to Griffith's Birth of a Nation (Micheaux subtitled this A Story of the Ku Klux Klan after all). Still, the arc ambition and franker-than-era's-usual depiction of conflict make for stretches of compelling silent cinema."
dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde-1920,peng,6,"Rather uninspired silent-film direction for this particular story, but Barrymore's grandiose style, and effective early effects in changing Jekyll/Hyde, more than make up for it."
alice-1988,peng,7,"If I watched this as a kid, the sound design (especially the White Rabbit's ""slurps"") accompanied by these images would have stayed with me forever."
wicked-2024,peng,7,"Despite being completely new to this musical/story (apart from the trailers) and overwhelmed by the concentrated theater-kid-energy supernova that is the film's marketing and press tour, I surprisingly get drawn in to this by the end, even with some real flaws. Chiefly: the world-building and general story here, even with expanded runtime to flesh out this (half a story!) more than the stage show, still come off skimpy and incomplete, especially concerning the animal oppression that directly affects Erivo's arc.‚Ä¶"
the-penalty,peng,8,"""What an admirable pair of legs."" This is the kind of off-the-wall operatic material that silent-film images can enhance and in which talkies would have a hard time balancing the tone. But maybe the latter can be pulled off if it still has a legless Lon Chaney in another banger performance, exuding revengeful menace and little pangs of vulnerability so well, whether being a crime boss forcing women into a sweatshop making hat or posing as Satan for his revenge target's daughter to make sculptress out of."
our-mothers-house,peng,7,"Six years after The Innocents, director Jack Clayton tackles another story about ways that children can be corrupted, although this time there is no ambiguity on whether it can be supernatural, just them first being left on their own device before a malicious figure comes in as corrupting influence. I do think seven children may be a few too many that both the thematic and narrative focuses are diffused among each, even though as an ensemble they're stellar enough. Builds in queasy, morbid momentum as it goes along and culminates in an act that seems inevitable in retrospect. A chilling, poignant little gem."
noroi-the-curse,peng,7,"Runs a bit long, especially when it nears the end and the eventual story doesn't feel justified that length enough for me. But this switches up every so often its format of found footage, documentary, and tv shows so that it creates a variation of raw-intimacy methods that enhances the increasingly freaky horror story well. Within every format's different texture it also manages to always locate unsettling images, especially as the second half often goes into full-on nerve-wracking territory -- weeks later and that sequence starting with people running hysterically into the woods still stay with me."
gladiator-ii,peng,7,"A pale shadow of the original's arc, but I still had a reasonably good time from my love of that first film and also this sequel getting more threads in to support that arc repeat, but with a lesser climax in having all those confrontations and death(s) feel rushed. Scott for his part still retains some his rousing action epic cred, even if it's more in stretches and not all the way through. He's almost anonymous in large-scale stuff like‚Ä¶"

faya-dayi,peng,6,"Immersive and frustrating in equal measure. I admire its ambition to break away from traditional doc form and aim for sensory approach of capturing a community and its habitants, all revolving around psychoactive plant khat.

That is also where we see the emergence of activists, in which the film (or‚Ä¶"
agatha-all-along-2024,peng,7,"Every acting choice Kathryn Hahn makes is the correct one. The series pulls a nifty sleight of hand by cloaking one of MCU's more intricately plotted entries under its light adventure-comedy tone, which becomes apparent in the last three episodes, especially the grand seventh one ""Death's Hand in Mine"". It employs a time-slipping structure that is done so well on both narrative and emotional levels, in a way that has me recall the most of The Haunting of Bly Manor‚Äôs similarly great ‚ÄúThe Altar of the Dead‚Äù, and some aspects also to the pinnacle of this kind of structure, Lost's ""The Constant""."
backstairs,peng,7,"Feels such a proto-The Last Laugh with its minimal intertiles, expressionistic visual/architecture, and some real bleak worldview."
dead-of-night,peng,7,"Little droll horror-comedy delight, in which each story comes off at least good by smart ordering. ""The Hearse Driver"" and ""The Christmas Party"" serve nicely as introductory atmospheric mood-settlers, before plunging audience into one of its two best with the psychological horror twistiness of ""The Haunted Mirror"". Then to not dilute the two best ones by cramming them together, it breaks them up with an effective palate cleanser of comedic ""The Golfer's Story"", before of course the deservedly most famous of this anthology in the concentrated creepiness of ""The Ventriloquist's Dummy""."
lawrence-of-arabia,peng,9,"First-watch in my mid-teens about two decades ago has me previously logged this as 4/5, from my memory of admiring more than loving it, with a deflating feeling towards the end of it decreasing in epic majesty. Turns out that is entirely by design, which I find thrillingly subversive this time.I also wrongly remembered this as more sprawling than it actually was, when for an epic this is uncommonly focused on us situating by Lawrence's side almost all the‚Ä¶"
tolable-david,peng,7,"Whereas another Henry King The White Sister two years later accentuates the sublime high melodrama in its plot turns and heightened passion, this takes almost the opposite approach in mining emotions from relatively more life-sized realism, from its rural location to the character's actions and reactions, that it frequently reaches some lyrical human poetry. Easy to see why this rich proto-community portrait is a John Ford favorite that echoes down the decades in his filmography, and Richard Barthelmess gives one of the great silent film performances, both lifelike and expressive."
the-slumber-party-massacre,peng,6,"For me, satirical comedy undercurrent but straightforward slasher surface has a ceiling of how effective it can go in either direction (well, except for the glorious ""[The body]'s so cold"" -- ""Is the pizza?"" moment, and some broad but effectively employed phallic-driller imagery), but it results in a generally fun slasher atmosphere at least."
never-weaken,peng,8,"A rare comedy short divided into three distinct set-piece sections (a ruse to get people to go see a doctor, suicidal attempts, building) in which each section is great in its own right and outranks the previous one. That building set-piece is such an outright classic that understandably Lloyd fine-hones it further for Safety Last!."
the-high-sign,peng,8,"One of Keaton's less oft-mentioned works turns out to be my favorite of his stellar and prolific 1921 run of shorts, having a legit actual (gangster) plot that doesn't detract from but adds to the comedic narrative energy and momentum. It then culminates in a spectacular climax of hidden-trap, secret-passage house chase, done in a static one shot of two-floor house-plan tableau, with many different moving parts and characters to pile on the gag mayhem."
the-play-house,peng,8,"While I loved this, I was thinking during it that it seems to lack some patent Keaton physical stunt set-pieces evident in his shorts during this period, so no surprise to read afterwards that this was devised around him having a broken ankle at the time. Instead of being restricted, this seems to increase his creativity into other areas, of technical wizardry, visual gags, and inventive scenarios. Coupled with the story taking place around a single location of stage theater, it makes for one of Keaton's most focused, humor-densest shorts ever."
the-haunted-house,peng,7,"I liked this Keaton short more than The Frozen North, but that one's more surrealist mean streak might have worked better with this sometimes random collection of scenarios and gags strung together. A few great bits throughout though (ghost traffic, stairs), although the best one (glue antics) is right around the beginning."
the-sacrifice,peng,7,"As frequently noted, this feels like Tarkovsky + Bergman, and it turns out I personally find the combination a mixed result, with the overt existential crisis and performance histrionics, even if compelling in itself, clanging instead of complementing Tarkovsky's ethereal style somewhat, especially in the mid-section. Spectacular finale though, great as ending for the film's personal moral drama and existential modern-world terror, and perfect as the final sequence of Tarkovsky's career.Also, ""Casting: Claire Denis"" in the beginning credit throws me for a loop, which leads me down the rabbit hole to this quote of hers (talking with Rian Johnson!) about it afterwards."
the-four-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse,peng,7,"Made only a few years after WWI ends, so the atmosphere of this early war epic in depicting society and families building towards it feels so immediate, potent, and terrifying, and includes such unsparing silent-film wartime imagery as the shilling of a town, a firing squad on resisting villagers, and the aftermath of kids hugging their mother's body."
the-three-musketeers-1921,peng,7,"Paradoxically, the rating wouldn't be this high if I hadn't already watched its sequel The Iron Mask (1929) first, but I also wish I'd seen this before the sequel. As strong as that one already is to me, it would have been enhanced even further if I have this establishing story and character dynamics beforehand, and to see the touching parallel between returning, older actors; this one's carefree spirit with the sequel's wistful tone; and Douglas Fairbanks bookending the drastically developing cinema decade and sending out the silent era."
anora,peng,8,"This feels like Sean Baker's least community portrait-reliant film in a long while, which may explain why the third act's comedown, usually common with his stories, has a deflating air that goes beyond narratively intentional into a bit listless (great, great final scene though). I'm noting my one personal con up first as the reason for this not surpassing The Florida Project as my favorite of the director's; Anora's third act enveloped and enriched by one of his previous community‚Ä¶"
beetlejuice-beetlejuice,peng,6,"What semi-saves this is a feeling of Burton reinvigorated in filmmaking spirit, with its imaginatively crafted retro look and plenty of visual ideas in any given scene. A shame then that it lacks a real story spark for sequel idea, contending to mostly mirror the original but crammed with more characters and subplots, so that the original's feeling of forward-momentum spontaneity becomes strained and unfocused. Still, Burton returning to more handmade sensibility and the fine ensemble help buoy it a‚Ä¶"
the-innkeepers,peng,6,"Similar throwback exercise as The House of the Devil, but I prefer this over that more acclaimed one. West's earlier film feels so hermetically sealed in its style to me somehow, to the suffocation that makes the third-act turn feels a bit jarring. This one opens up to more human elements, with various guests in the inn and especially the bored interplay between Sara Paxton and Pat Healy, which adds to the spooky atmosphere and later well-employed scares immensely."
strange-darling,peng,5,"Was already on the fence throughout most of it -- I don't mind a mindtrick film but this goes a borderline obnoxiously loud, ostentatious way about it, from the 35MM announcement to the blaring chapter names, although it also can be stylishly fun, with Kyle Gallner and especially Willa Fitzgerald giving two terrific lead performances -- but then it centers a crucial late turn around those two cops. I can maybe see the broader aim of it to say something‚Ä¶"
the-blot,peng,7,"Turns out intricacy in character details I see in my first Lois Weber film Too Wise Wives is a firm directorial trait, and when applied to a less unsteadily stack-the-deck story, like this one's money melodrama, it enhances the realism and empathy greatly, so that the standard narrative beats come off fresh and engrossing with specific details. Grace notes, character layers, and telling reaction shots are afforded to several members of the ensemble, even on the margin of narrative (such‚Ä¶"
chime,peng,8,"Kiyoshi Kurosawa's horror formal chop distilled and condensed into 45 minutes, so that the very air crackles with menacing, free-floating malaise throughout, as if there is no need for Cure-like figures to pass along the unleashing of population's darkness anymore."
alligator,peng,7,"Youngest I ever see Robert Forster (my next earliest film of his is Jackie Brown) and it turns out he has always been this authentic sturdy presence that is exactly the right kind to ground a monster outing; he even came up with and wrote the hair jokes himself. Coupled with a John Sayles script that takes the town texture and character dynamics seriously while still being light on its narrative feet, it helps the overall fun atmosphere of the film, keeping us engaged even in its exposition downtime and enhancing the chomping set-pieces very well."
videodrome,peng,8,"This film and the word ""prescient"" probably have 90%+ overlap in reviews, but apart from the emergence of internet and its malaise, it's remarkably predictive in other aspects as well, from James Woods' sleaze to even having its DNA right in this year's Red Rooms. And those ideas are wrapped in such distinctly nightmarish, fleshy world-building, so that even when narrative goes paranoid and diffuse along with the lead's headspace -- in a way that is often tricky for filmmakers‚Ä¶"
the-boat,peng,8,"Keaton vs machine and technology from beginning to end, in which comedy comes from both when things work right (I get a kick out of how the boat is rigged to go under bridges) and when/until they don't (the rotating cabin is a great classic set-piece of course, but also: when he turns on a contraption that accidentally pushes his kid into the sea)."
hard-luck,peng,6,"Sometimes Keaton's collection-of-gags short film can excel, but this puts the best ones at the beginning with the spontaneous creativity of (as weird as that may sound, but silent comedies around these years traffic in that aplenty) his character's suicidal attempts, before downshifting into lower-key mode of more amiable physical gags, even if the final one still looks great and can elicit a gasp over 100 years later."
roadgames,peng,7,"Between Psycho II and this flavorful Rear Window-in-a-truck reconfiguration, director Richard Franklin gets the knack for doing Hitchcock material and homage without coming off as mere retread down pat."
anna-karenina-2012,peng,7,"Several dents here: even as a non-book reader, I can tell there's some wobbly adapting job going on during third act; the theatrical conceit is inconsistently employed; Aaron fuckin' Taylor-Johnson (on the other end of genre spectrum, Godzilla hinders itself by choosing his bland presence as the human focus)... but that gorgeously orchestrated conceit so totally overwhelms me into submission. Whenever it appears, Wright's camera helps heighten the characters' feeling and situations' turn into the stratosphere; if it's up to me, that expressionistic tableau of a waltz scene could have gone on forever."
the-house-of-the-devil,peng,6,MVP Greta Gerwig
cuckoo-2024,peng,6,"Wobbly, unsatisfying script that needs to either lean closer to tighter world-building or lose it in favor of pure stylish atmosphere altogether, in which Tilman Singer manages to deliver some of the latter in spite of the exposition that threatens to interrupt ever so often (that scene with the bike and ever-closer shadow delivers the genre's goods). At least it has a cohering force from a kick-ass lead performance in Hunter Schafer, plus Dan Stevens' deliciously unhinged supporting turn, and I love that moment with two-sided door as the last note to leave the film out on."
too-wise-wives,peng,6,"My first Lois Weber, and even adjusted for its time the story still feels stacking the deck in favor of the men too much, but it's countered by Weber writing her women's more intricate thought process well so that they at least lean towards humanly flawed rather than flatly shrill. I do love Weber's intertiles though, with their following scenes often spliced in to pair with the words, making them visually interesting."
divine-intervention,peng,7,"My first Elia Suleiman was It Must Be Heaven (2019), so I came to his first two, Chronicle of a Disappearance (1996) and Divine Intervention (2002), backwards before they were leaving Netflix (along with a whole bunch of other Palestinian films) mid-October. Remarkably consistent approach of deadpan absurdist sketches from first to latest feature, to the point that I'm curious how his film in between The Time That Remains (2009) becomes his most acclaimed on letterboxd by a hair. I‚Ä¶"
dreamgirls,peng,5,"Granted, the four other Bill Condon films I saw are all from the 2010s so I haven't gotten to his more decently acclaimed ones yet, but his best for me still remains, somehow, the final Twilight film."
the-kid,peng,8,"Pretty sure this was both my first Chaplin and my first silent film (whether short or feature) back when I was 13-14. My prevalent memory of the film is the image of Coogan crying and pleading from the authority truck, which remained with me two decades later from its unexpected force of pathos, as then I had no knowledge of Chaplin beyond ""famous silent comedienne"". And indeed this film probably showcases him more as dramatist than comedienne -- though there's‚Ä¶"
oddity-2024,peng,7,"At heart an old-fashioned chiller -- I can imagine this story as a 30s-50s horror -- but updated with tight modern craft, a bit of non-linear storytelling, and sustaining a classically dread-filled atmosphere. I liked that the set-pieces come off a succession of little classic what-if horror scenarios executed with effective camerawork -- starting from that terrific opening that feels like a moral horror short story of ""Should I open the door to a scary stranger's warning in the middle of the night?"" in which each careful cut of that surrounding contributes to a shivery sensation that something horrific might be revealed around the next corner."
la-morte-rouge,peng,7,"Googling didn't turn up anything so it may be a connection made on my end rather than actual inspiration, but this really feels like a mirror image (short film version) of Kleber Mendon√ßa Filho's recent Pictures of Ghosts. Like Mendon√ßa Filho later, Victor Erice similarly evokes and traces his childhood's relationship with cinema that leads directly to his debut film (I didn't realize the specificity of Erice also learning about death and murder also from a film, but in his‚Ä¶"
four-around-the-woman,peng,6,"The portrayal of German upper-class society in this feels partly presaging Lang's vision of Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler one year later, but here the director plays these characters' devious deception and ruthless self-interest for farce, with mixed result. The plot twistiness never quite cohere into the screwball rhythm that would elevate the film, even if some interlocking threads still pay off in the end."
hamlet-1921,peng,7,"Didn't entirely live up to the ""silent German gender-swapped Hamlet"" premise because the directors don't aim at the chance for expected expressionism enough to compensate for lack of the play's written words. Still some solid framing and very good production design that contribute to a lot of memorable images. And Asta Nielsen as the lead more than elevates the film with her fiercely, simultaneously wild and vulnerable performance for this version of Hamlet, who is born a girl but has‚Ä¶"
dream-of-light,peng,8,"Process cinema steeped in Erice's tactile, sensory touch."
rebel-ridge,peng,8,"Saulnier modulates a fascinating tone that feels halfway between procedural realism (full of police codes and legal jargon) and full-on action set-pieces. I get why some might find that ""uncommitted"", but for me the two disparate sides complement rather than pull away from each other, giving enormous weight to the unusually nonlethal set-pieces that do occur, while lending simmering powder keg tension to the procedural sections that would normally come off as lower-energy exposition point in more standard action films,‚Ä¶"
sleep-2023,peng,7,"I find the overall story lean towards on the nonsensical side (Feels like the world-building should be a little more filled-in to stress the film's own internal logic fuller), so it's a testament to the two leads and especially Jason Yu's direction that the execution rises quite above the plot for me. Jung Yu-mi and Lee Sun-kyun (RIP) being in three previous Hong Sang-soo relationship dramas together seems to help lend familiar chemistry that makes their dynamic really work. Yu,‚Ä¶"
superbad,peng,7,"I have the same very amused but not loved reaction as back then, although I appreciate Michael Cera much more this time, with how the teen raunchy comedy tropes come off fresh in his awkward off-handed delivery and character. The funniest moment for me is when Jonah Hill accidentally headbutts Emma Stone though."
grandmas-boy,peng,8,"One of the stronger and more effective narrative throughlines for a Harold Lloyd film, so even if there isn't quite a memorable knock-out set-piece to rank within his own canon, all the physical gags and visual humor feel like building steps in Lloyd's coming-of-age character and his grandma's encouragement of it, and make the film has an engaging and delightful flow."
bells-are-ringing,peng,7,"Minor Minnelli musical that lacks the spark -- whether in energy or narrative -- of his best works, but also delightful enough to coast along pleasantly. Another great Judy Holliday performance though, ranging from comedy (the way her voice pitches a double or triple octaves higher when denying another woman to ‚Äútake him to the RACE!‚Äù and chasing her off) to pathos (a gorgeous, heartrending rendition of ""The Party's Over""). Plus it's baller of Minnelli to direct a musical with a song about name-dropping famous people of the era's culture and it includes his own name."
the-valley-of-silent-men,peng,6,"Maybe the first silent film I see that feels clearly adapted from a novel, if not faithfully in details then in structure, because even with scenes missing (filled in by production stills and intertiles instead), the film feels lopsided towards the ending with succession of narrative revelations, too fast and crammed together to be satisfying, so I suspect they work better on pages. The atmosphere from Borzage's location shooting, captured by the director's sumptuous staging as usual, helps elevate the human drama enough though."
the-solid-gold-cadillac,peng,8,"My love for this is less for its corporate satire, which starts biting then ultimately goes soft even if it remains fun through, than for it being such an ultimate Judy Holliday lead vehicle, showing off her talent for modulating her comedic persona at full force. It also lets me see how her performance, though not exactly modern, has the framework of that era's broader performance tenor, but also contains many distinct naturalistic touches that seem counterintuitive on the page‚Ä¶"
life-without-principle,peng,7,"Johnnie To's interconnected-narrative film, and if it's obvious and blunt all the way about the financial crisis plot element that affects each storyline, To's touch is also fleeter than someone like I√±√°rritu would have done, laced with dark humor and unabashedly thriller elements of time-ticking suspense. Arguably peaks too early with the stomach-churning, slow-motion-trainwreck sequence of a banker pushing a senior customer to invest in high-risk mutual fund that she isn't remotely prepared for, in which Soh Hang-suen's sympathetic deer-in-headlight‚Ä¶"
longlegs,peng,6,"My conclusion from Perkins' previous three films has been that his style plays stronger the simpler he keeps the story, which is why my favorite remains I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House. For the first half of this I thought he had made a film that finally defied that, with the sinister nature of both his pervasive dread-filled compositions and building procedural narrative working together very snugly. I'm among those who like Cage's performance, partly because‚Ä¶"
five-easy-pieces,peng,8,"Utterly different story, but some of the lead's core throughline has me recall Manchester by the Sea. And even if I loved Lonergan's film more, both Five Easy Pieces and Nicholson's performance constitute a trickier high-wire act, as the similar throughline of hollowed-out existentialism (captured by ""There's nothing there"" in Lonergan's film) doesn't come from a more easily understandable traumatic reckoning of self-punishment like in the 2016 film. Here it is borne out of a more difficult but finely etched‚Ä¶"
cinderella-1922,peng,7,"Director Lotte Reiniger made a 13-minute short pre-The Adventures of Prince Achmed that feels like a proof of concept before expanding fully to that one, and demonstrates how her style of silhouette animation always gives the familiar such a dose of intricate wonder and dark imagination."
red-eye,peng,7,"I loved that Cillian Murphy never essentially change his character post-reveal; his performance reads as both charming and creepy from the start, but he just modulates that ratio so the creepy comes off to Rachel McAdams as of the generic rom-com variety in the early going, while the charming later is the proud professionalism on chilling display. The film also has several delightfully idiosyncratic guest-character one-or-two scenes to give side colors to its thriller narrative, like an asshole doctor's eye-rolled sigh then ""woah"" when seeing that throat, or a fight attendant's pointed ""trash"" at Murphy before landing."
maxxxine,peng,5,"Weird pacing and lurching narrative, where most of the film feels like some establishing scenes that will tease to a main story, until we arrive at the climatic shootout, which makes this whole entry come off like it consists of a first act's beginnings for almost 1.5 hours and then straight to the ending. Some stray pleasures in sleazy 80's slasher texture and Goth's performance, halfway cohering the film by her presence and energy alone, but a bigger scope than last two films seem to defeat West into the worst, most sloppy entry to end his trilogy with."
cops,peng,8,"One of Keaton's best shorts also resembles his features, with organically building narrative/chaos existing alongside many inspired physical feats and set-pieces. But not being feature seemingly allows him to make it among his darkest as well (which somehow complements the humor rather than distracts from the fun); his protagonist seems to get defeated into a new corner at every turn, ending with a sting so sudden your laugh may rise and choke in your throat at the same time."
the-paleface,peng,6,"Plenty of unfortunate redface on display, but at least Keaton has all characters equally befuddled by his stone face's antics and the real bad guys being oil crooks. No real memorable set-piece and more a series of successive physical bits (though that parachute gag is the best one and could have been developed further), which makes it ""just"" amiable in term of Keaton shorts."
the-substance,peng,8,"Another film released in the same month that could also have A Fable affixed to its title. My one big (though eventually irrelevant) complaint is that, even accounting for its hyperstylized logic and world-building as befit an allegory/fable, a few of the mechanics here feel shortchanged and almost muddled instead of elegantly simplified. I can supply my own interpretation (Sue starts out with the same consciousness and memory, but diverges as her own person once she steps out to have‚Ä¶"
femme-2023,peng,7,"Some plot contortions to set the main scenario (and then the climax) into place, but once it gets going this erotic revenge thriller feels so attuned to the raw messiness of two characters involved, with Nathan Stewart-Jarrett and George MacKay giving such psychologically credible hair-pin turns, that some sequences are truly intense and agonizingly suspenseful to watch unfold. The performances also help transform that ending, which I would usually have a problem with in feeling on paper more a pause point, into something cathartic too."
back-pay-1922,peng,7,"Later silent Borzage would fill in his signature template (which comes rather well formed this early, with even a wartime component) with more narrative and visual details, which would help a few aspects of the ending to not veer a little close to almost didactic. But his sweeping romantic and spiritual sense is already finely etched enough so the whole of that ending still comes off richly emotional anyway."
catch-22,peng,7,"Not the book (what film can be?), but Mike Nichols manages this adaptation to be both faithful to the book's spirit and also its own thing. He doesn't just merely transpose words to screen, but finds visual correlations and substitutes to the literary/verbal of Joseph Heller's wartime absurdities, which becomes clear right off the bat with an extended wordless opening. Nichols also cannily arranges the timeline to pivot around an eerie Snowden white-out sequence so the second half's gravity feels‚Ä¶"
the-electric-house,peng,7,"The earliest kind of humor I watched a lot as a kid is of the Rube Goldberg variety (I liked Looney Tunes shorts with that sensibility the most, and Home Alone is among my early childhood favorites), so of course Keaton with humor and set-pieces among contraptions and gadgets of that sort would endear to me a lot, even if the short itself speeds through them for any real grand, memorable Keaton-esque set-piece to take place. That automatic stair that canon-shoots people out the window is a foolproof recurring bit though."
the-blacksmith,peng,6,"One vintage Keaton train gag near the end, but this short mostly coasts by on little visual from his destructive side, setting him as a blacksmith so his character can wreak havoc on objects, vehicles, and people that come through the shop for repair. Which may be minor but is not an unpleasant or uncreative way for his humor, really."
phantom-1922,peng,5,"Finally a Murnau I would consider outright mediocre. Standard-scenario melodrama of over two hours, in which its arc of downward spiral from obsession would only make sense with a young protagonist (and written as so in the story), so it's further constrained by the miscast of 43-year-old Alfred Abel, who looks older. Marginally saved by the story chips that have been set up long over the film finally toppling down during the last section, and also by the lead's flights of obsessive fantasy/nightmare, which feel the only (too infrequent) parts where Murnau wakes his expressionistic self up."
ghostlight-2024,peng,6,"How much I mind contrivances in my melodramas depend on the context. If it's painted in stylized, broad stroke and I'm caught up with it, dinging on them just feel like unproductive CinemaSins-ing in the grand scheme of things. But if a film is in a naturalistic, raw register intended to progress by step the story of familial grief, hinging on one big contrivance of mapping a theater play our leads are involved in to a real-life circumstance they have‚Ä¶"
project-a-part-ii,peng,7,"Been a while since I saw the first one, but I feel this sequel alternates between plot and set-pieces more adeptly, with the highlight being that extended Maggie Cheung's house sequence, which is a pure delight in its combination of Looney Tunes hide-and-seek escalation and Jackie Chan's fast physical feats (which nearly all characters eventually partake in). Afterwards its momentum moves along at even more fun pace; its climax substitutes the original's bigger scale with more intimate fights and chases through creatively thought-out obstacles and locations, which works better for me. That Buster Keaton tribute of falling house is like the final bow on top."
my-wifes-relations,peng,7,"Thinner on inspired set-pieces by Keaton short standard, but made up by lively ensemble and a grand house-destroying finale."
day-dreams,peng,7,"The premise is a really good way to structure a short of separate set-pieces together coherently, also allowing the girl's ""day dreams"" as intro for each one. Great group-chasing-Keaton scene, and half a star for that final dark-humor sting alone."
nosferatu,peng,8,"Always grateful for Thai Blockbuster for, among other things, their (often VCD) classic series of Best Picture and Monster films, both stretching all the way back to silent era. It was how I watched Sunrise, 1925's The Phantom of the Opera, and this Murnau around my mid-teen, which was such an integral part of me watching older films young, some of which endure more than others. I remember barely anything from The Phantom of the Opera except for some striking,‚Ä¶"
tuesday-2023,peng,6,"Fantasy drama about grieving process, in which its fantasy gets pretty out there even beyond what the trailer suggests, and doesn't feel established or intuitive in world-building logic enough to land entirely despite its admirably big reach. What lands entirely though is Julia Louis-Dreyfus's performance, straddling the film's veering tonal range effortlessly while always locating the raw parental anguish underneath it all."
foolish-wives,peng,7,"Feels its length in a skimpy way that, coupled with learning how heavily it's been cut down, suggests a film that would feel shorter with the original longer cut. Of all von Stroheim's studio-scissored films this comes off the most seamless narrative-wise though, with his extravagantly expressionistic visual combined with opulent sets to create a dryly amused, amoral tone, plus a dash of modern meta-ness (an appearance of a book with the film's title written by the director himself). This also becomes my favorite of von Stroheim's own performances alongside Sunset Blvd. from how he plays the brash villainy of his character to the tilt."
summer-hours,peng,8,"The logistics of death, inheritance, and what inanimate objects we decide to imbue with generational attachment as they pass on. Loved how the finale at first seems to wield Assayas' own Cold Water homage with potential didactic old-man despondent tone, before a quiet detour exquisitely deepens the sequence into something overpoweringly tender and poignant. The kids are alright."
a-quiet-place-day-one,peng,6,"Really feels so much like Sarnoski's ethos from Pig dropped whole into a monster film, right down to using a needle drop as emotional release for the very end. It might have worked better if the set-pieces are not conceptually underimagined, and if it doesn't feel like the drama part and horror part are kept mostly separated rather than intertwined, as in these monster appearances come off interrupting the character arcs. It's elevated though by a bracingly fatalistic lead that‚Ä¶"
haxan,peng,8,"Decades ahead of its time, maybe even still ahead of our time somehow, in its engrossing mix of essayist documentary and historical dramatization, while still works well as a visually evocative silent horror. That it manages to culminate most of itself into a statement of institutional misogyny from the witchcraft age to the supposed scientific, enlightened present only strengthens its dark expressionistic imagery all the more."
the-bikeriders,peng,6,"This boasts Nichols' usual strength of locating tactile details under the big picture, but this may be a case of the director having his biggest scope to date defeating him a bit. The film has the feeling of those generic cradle-to-grave biopics even though it's culture ethnography, since it's lacking an internalized spark from its majority viewpoint being of a mostly passive outsider. I've seen more than a few Goodfellas comparisons, and there's a reason why Karen is not that‚Ä¶"
nanook-of-the-north,peng,7,"Tone is half-exoticizing, half-warmly detailed, but it's the friction of being docufiction -- actual living process (even if of past tradition before the film's already modernization time) within staging framework -- that proves most fascinating. That framework allows for some dramatic work seeping in by way of initial intertiles that are quite elegiac from providing what happened beyond the film, while the documentary part allows it to be light on plot and focus on living/survival process that is engrossing in its in-depth depiction."
the-girl-without-hands,peng,7,"Coming backwards from Laudenbach's second film Chicken for Linda to his debut here, it confirms what I vaguely suspected after watching that film that I find his particular animated style more suited to this Grimm fable than contemporary mother-daughter relationship, even if it renders the latter lovely in its own right. But the animation of starkly brushed movements and contrasting color splashes seems born for the harsh, surreal turns of fairy tales; its expressiveness abstracts the violence and sexuality while heightening their resulting emotions and wonders gorgeously."
the-mexican,peng,6,"A film of splintered parts, in which I find each one ranked in effectiveness as followed: Pitt-Roberts romance < Pitt's solo crime caper <<< Roberts-Gandolfini road-trip buddy adventure. Roberts looks far more at home in the loose, relaxed road trip parts than the bickering romance framework, which kinda hinders the film's ending stretch a fair bit. It's also not helped by a supporting Gandolfini being by far the film's most interesting, layered character and the best performance. But even when the film slows and stutters in its less sturdy sections, Verbinski's lively, fluid direction helps elevate the proceedings as usual."
infernal-affairs-iii,peng,6,"I imagine the writing room's process in mapping this entry as akin to that Charlie Day conspiracy rant meme. Being both prequel and sequel to Infernal Affairs requires re-writing/adjacent-writing of the original‚Äôs events and characters, and that might have actually subtracted from the first film for me if this is any bit more coherent or less confusing from the graceless timeline jumping around. Saving graces are the sequel section‚Äôs rather bracing endgame and having both Leung and Lau back, as‚Ä¶"
infernal-affairs-ii,peng,7,"Trades in the original‚Äôs lean, mean power of propulsive cat-and-mouse game for Godfather II-style prequel ambition of being a different expansive beast, to the point of at times meandering, messy plotting and intercutting. But both the ambition and difference mean that the film doesn‚Äôt feel like a retread, but its own story; pivoting on the Hong Kong Handover event lends a historical heft to the power struggle, by a sense of different factions needing to find their own control footing‚Ä¶"
souls-for-sale,peng,7,"An entertaining showbiz stardom drama that is much enhanced by the feeling of verisimilitude of early Hollywood behind-the-scenes in both film making and star system. Those range from famous cameos, glimpses at real film shootings (Erich von Stroheim doing Greed and Charlie Chaplin A Woman of Paris!), to actual details depicting the works: our lead's first audition with bright lights distracting her, an onset accident that actually makes me gasp, and a destructive finale that still has the director order his cameraman to keep shooting through deadly chaos in case the footage can be used later."
fancy-dance-2023,peng,7,"The two parallel, intersecting threads of missing-person mystery and on-the-run, road-film relationship are individually potent in of themselves, but the wobbling back and forth undercuts the building focus of both, especially for the former which comes off almost too sloppy in plotting towards the end. The specificity of setting and ensemble cast, especially by Lily Gladstone and Isabel DeRoy-Olson, help elevate it somewhat though. And this is the case where a great ending reverberates backwards positively on the whole film;‚Ä¶"
kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes,peng,7,"A step-down from the preceding trilogy, mostly from the new lead who functions more as audience surrogate than being distinctively vivid in both characterization and arc like Caesar, and interesting supporting characters either are too few or have too little screentime to make the film feel populated enough for its conflict and dilemma to truly take flight. But this remains an improbably sturdy franchise; if it doesn't measure up to the trilogy (including the effects that are still so lush‚Ä¶"
news-item,peng,8,"A turbulent then violent love-triangle silent short, with plenty of expressionistic/surrealist techniques that make it feel so atmospheric and modern, so much that apart from brief character/actor name introductions at beginning, and shots of calendar indicating time go by, it doesn't have, or need, any intertile."
the-eye,peng,6,"Had mistakenly remembered this as a Thai film, both before and after my first watch a long time ago, since my most prevalent memory is the climatic sequence, based on a real-life Thai tragedy that happened a month before I was born; my association with the film since a kid is my mother telling how it is based on that incident, in which my father limits her watching the news since the grisliness might be too much for someone heavily‚Ä¶"
the-beast-2023-1,peng,8,"In which Bertrand Bonello takes his anxiety and anguish about the status of modern world, front and center in his previous essayist film Coma, and connects it to Henry James' novella The Beast in the Jungle. That that film and the novella, nearly 120 years apart, share a kinship spirit about ""essential loneliness"" of their own era feels like another rich layer upon The Beast, which uses both as springboard for expansion into what seems like the director's own epic‚Ä¶"
gretel-hansel,peng,6,"I find this right in the middle of the pack in term of Osgood Perkins' first three films. Not so much ""elevated horror"", more Perkins using his style to take this tale to its Grimm root, even with some story updates and all. Trouble is, the overall update feels half-conceived, working well when our siblings are on the move but reveal itself as underimagined once they situate themselves at the witch's house, making the second half ambling often. It ends‚Ä¶"
cur-fidele,peng,8,"The story is fairly conventional silent romantic melodrama, but Epstein's direction, full of techniques that make it feel like a late silent film just before the sound takes over, gives it such a huge boost of dreamy, lyrical atmosphere, whether it be a soft dissolve connecting the two far-apart lovers together or frenetic, repetitive cuts signifying emotional distress. All the principal performers here have faces that work wonder in Epstein's modern camerawork, including close-up, as well."
contraband-1940,peng,7,"The opening on cargo ship sets the period and characters, but it's after our leads get off the ship that the tone of this spy film is established, delectably of the Powell & Pressburger specialty in mixing broad genre/story framework with specific human eccentricity. In this case, the crackling spy yarn and developing romance are complemented by fantastic details of Britain in wartime: our leads have to buy ""torches""; the streets are pitched black; people recommend you to close your eyes‚Ä¶"
skywalkers-a-love-story,peng,7,"I wish this could have an IMAX run for all the vertigo-inducing footage here, reminding me of when I watched those scenes of MI4 and Zemeckis' The Walk in that theatrical format.

we-grown-now,peng,7,"A tricky stylistic and tonal balance for this story, but I fall on the side of finding its gliding visual and sensory imagery -- which can get borderline Malickian from its near ethereal evocation -- not minimizing the two kids' harsh surroundings. They are lyrically employed to convey how resilient a child's point of view can be in absorbing and filtering matter beyond their understanding, focusing instead on their age's wonder and friendship, with the heartbreak and weariness of adults around them enough for the audience to fill in the current risks, and to show what's at stake for the kids in the future."
the-pilgrim,peng,7,"Minor Chaplin comedy, which still coasts along enjoyably enough on utilizing his Tramp persona in different context. Not sure who feels more villainous here between the crook and the kid-from-hell, but both makes for some superlative physical set-pieces. Loved how the ending balances between crowd-pleasing and melancholy just right too."
i-am-the-pretty-thing-that-lives-in-the-house,peng,7,"Out of Osgood Perkins' first three films, this has the lowest average letterboxd score, so I hope it's not too pretentious to say that what makes it my favorite is precisely how it feels like the purest distillation of his directorial voice so far. The more bare-bone, single-location ghost story provides the best basis for his style, unencumbered by the first one's timeline-scrambling parallel occult threads or the third's fairy-tale arc enhancement. In this more limited scope, there is little‚Ä¶"
love-on-delivery,peng,7,"A lot of the comedy here is the sort of broad, conceptual wackiness and goofing-off that makes me not as much a fan of Wheels on Meals as others. Some actual characterization focus helps anchor it though, including a great Ng Man-Tat supporting turn that sharpens the Stephen Chow persona. Plus, it has an actual fighting philosophy that imbues the increasingly frequent, spatially coherent jokey-action set-pieces with internal-logic heft of rooting interest. And this is the case where they save‚Ä¶"
the-36th-chamber-of-shaolin,peng,9,"The beginning and ending are genre framework executed with sturdy craft, but they are hugely elevated and enriched by the justly famed middle section, which is training montage taken to pure myth-making highs, as close to process cinema as action genre comes in its engrossing, building ritualistic steps."
la-roue,peng,8,"Grand, excessive, life-encompassing melodrama -- half exasperating in its simplistic bigness on a story basis (I barely buy the character of brother Elie on a psychological level much, and even have a similarly difficult time with Sisif at some points), but always exhilarating in the execution that elevates plot turns and character arcs into narrative rhythm of epic intensity, through sheer ahead-of-its-time visual bravado which still retains much of its outsized, frequently ferocious emotions to this day. In the end, that exhilarating totality dwarfs the exasperating half enough for it to be a sweeping achievement."
curse-of-chucky,peng,5,"I get why Mancini would want a change of pace and go back to the franchise's root after Bride and Seed , but the first entry has a certain classical horror sensibility within 80‚Äôs slasher context that is here substituted by DTV sheen in both its look and general performances (excepting the lead Fiona Dourif). Some nifty staging of set-pieces, but the film as a whole feels absent both that sensibility and the two previous entries‚Äô meta-comedy (which I kinda loved) without anything else in their place enough."
presumed-innocent,peng,7,"Gordon Willis Shadow: The Movie. Can't quite escape its literary root of not fully adapted to another medium (this is quite better than Runaway Jury, but that story is suited to flow more as a film for me), and the tinge of misogyny around the victim feels extended beyond its characters'/milieu's viewpoint into the film's perspective. But this is so supremely crafted and expertly screw-tightening in ways that count, plus a great ensemble to carry it home, especially for that ending."
american-made,peng,6,"A case where the performance is a full step above the whole film. Doug Liman has this veer dangerously close to Montage: The Movie, seeming determined to make this historical take a 'good time' that he fast-directs it past any relationship or intrigue to properly develop, which is a problem in the back half as the story invariably needs to get more serious. But along with Edge of Tomorrow, his collaborations with Tom Cruise produce a lead performance that, if‚Ä¶"
the-blackcoats-daughter,peng,6,"I've watched Osgood Perkins' first three films by the time I'm writing this, and I find his distinct directorial style play stronger the simpler he keeps the narratives. So the parallel, timeline-scrambling strands here feel disruptive, both interrupting the dread that his visually shivery, sonically ambient aesthetic tries to sustain and muting the story's possible emotional impact that eventually emerges (since out of his first three films, this seems most promising to develop into something potent on the basis of‚Ä¶"

the-love-nest,peng,6,"Still not among the Keaton shorts that operate at his concentrated comedic power, contending just to amble amiably on, but better than his other 1923 short The Balloonatic from the story and its set-pieces having more a sense of flowing into the next one."
the-balloonatic,peng,6,"A short that turns out to be a series of very loosely connected set-pieces, all too mild to register except a few brief bits (the bears, the final scene), but it proves that out of all famous silent comediennes the Keaton persona really helps elevates even weaker bits just by the reactions of his nonplussed non-expressions alone."
footloose,peng,5,"I last saw the remake back when it was out on DVD, but still am pretty sure I find it far better than this original, mostly for the Craig Brewer of it all. By contrast, Herbert Ross, whose Steel Magnolias (my first film of his) I quite liked when watched last year, has touches that feel creaky throughout, including the finale that somehow comes off shrug-worthy apart from the song.

This is almost like a cast from a late 90s horror film, only in a drama instead. Phillipe wants to have sex with Geller in the worst way. Sadly, their parents wed some time ago, so they are now siblings, but still seem open to having sex. Ew. They make a bet that they can have sex‚Ä¶"

Hartnett is a father taking his daughter to a concert, where he notices a lot of police presence.

maxxxine,britbuffguy,7,"While I felt X was a decent film, I also didn't think it deserved all the hype it got. And I straight up hated PEARL. This was the best of the three films, and since it's an actual sequel to X, that probably helped. I will say that despite a few callbacks to that first film, there aren't any real connections. I kind of thought the secret killer was going to be someone in regard to the events in X.‚Ä¶"

william-shatner-you-can-call-me-bill,britbuffguy,5,"The first half of this one was okay, but it tries to go far too deep in the second half and all the serious tones didn't make it very watchable.Most of this is just random clips of acting roles Shatner has had, and then him telling random stories. There really wasn't an overall narrative or anything, and then when he gets to the end when he's going on about nature and space, I got really bored with this. The movie itself ends with a very long shot of a random tree. Boring."

rally-road-racers,britbuffguy,5,"This was one of those lesser animated films, so it never looks as good as it probably should. Pretty much the underdog vs the big bad guy kind of movie. A lot of racing action. There is a romance subplot between the lead character and one that works for the bad guy. Everything here is pretty cliched city.Some nice use of songs and I liked Bennet as the voice of the love interest. Just nothing really special about this one."
passed-away,britbuffguy,6,"I mean, just look at that cast. It's a very loaded cast and a simple story.Sadly, for Jack Warden, his character dies pretty early, and his funeral is the setting for this story, as his family gathers, and drama ensures. While Hoskins, and his slight affair with Nancy Travis, gets a decent subplot, I think they had such a great cast they didn't give any of the others anything solid to do.

out-of-darkness-2022,britbuffguy,4,"Should note that every listing I found for this said it was in English, it's not, if that matters.This is about a small tribe of people in the Stone Age fighting off some unseen beast that begins to pick them off, one by one. It's a really dark movie, probably to hide the beast from most of the film, so it plays with shadows. You hear it, you just don't see it until the final twenty minutes or so.‚Ä¶"

the-lair-2022,britbuffguy,5,"Pretty basic action/horror film where a downed pilot stumbles onto a bunker that had some sort of experiments happening, and these monsters get released and follow her scent to a nearby military base she is taken to. Basically, it becomes military guys fighting monsters. The monsters have some decent practical effects going for them, but all the action scenes just feel like something out of a B movie. Kirk is fine as the sexy and badass leading lady, but the only marine that stood out was Barber, and it was due to his awful acting. It's an okay watch just rather generic."

I myself had come to believe that James Comey was some Republican stooge that basically gave the election to Donald Trump in 2016. While his actions probably helped, this film gives us his side of things. It's a miniseries of two parts. The first part was the buildup to the 2016 election.

Her younger cousin in this very awkward, gay guy, that seems to have developed a crush on her boyfriend. To be honest, nothing much happens but a basic camping trip. The two younger guys go off to a side party to get some girls at one point, but it's a lot of just sitting around and talking. It was okay, but nothing I'll remember in another week."
the-grab,britbuffguy,6,"The content of this one was a big scary, as while half of America refuses to do anything about climate change, it seems like the rest of the world is already putting things in place regards to food and water.

But you have a lot of other major countries buying up resources for the day when they could become scarce.‚Ä¶"

american-strays,britbuffguy,4,"This one had a really nice cast with one of those 90s plots where all these different groups of people meet up in one location and all hell breaks loose. Sadly, it wasn't very good. I will say there's the main plot where people all end up in this diner, and then there is a subplot of Perry wanting Sam Jones to murder him that happens nearby, but away from the rest of the action. You have two gangsters that‚Ä¶"

force-of-nature-the-dry-2,britbuffguy,6,"I did see the original film last year and when I added this to my 2024 watchlist, it felt odd to see that film got a sequel. Not really the type of movie you'd see a sequel for. This one was yet another longer film, and slow burn mystery as well. While the first one dealt with issues Bana was going through, he only knows the missing woman in this one, as five women go out on this wilderness retreat‚Ä¶"
darkness-of-man,britbuffguy,3,"A review that slipped by me, and while I only watched this ten days ago, I remember almost nothing from it. In and out of my brain like most low budget films. This one had Van Damme going after bad guys to rescue this kid he was looking over. Lots of bland C-Level action scenes and Van Damme was looking really old here.

johnny-mnemonic,britbuffguy,4,"90s rewatch #2. I didn't recall hating this one so much as just remembering it being a bad movie. But after a rewatch, it's pretty awful. I still couldn't explain the plot to you if I tried.

The lead girl, Burrell, also is tasked with making some sort of video short.There isn't much skiing to be had here, and the overall plot is pretty tame. One girl shits herself at one point but that's about as far as it goes with any gags. No sex, no real nudity. No real language. None of the leading ladies are very interesting‚Ä¶"
the-present-2024,britbuffguy,4,"Maybe one of the blandest time travel movies I have ever seen. Kinnear and Fisher are a couple about to announce to their kids that they're getting a divorce. Somehow, their three kids discover this old clock in their basement can reset time, so they keep trying to keep their parents from getting a divorce. That's literally the entire plot. They just reset the same day and try all these things that never change anything. The youngest kid barely talks.‚Ä¶"

whispers-in-the-dark,britbuffguy,5,"This had most of the elements of those early 90s thrillers with the exotic elements. I say most, as this one was lacking the smut stuff that so many of those films from that era had. Sciorra makes a fine lead, but she doesn't really do much of the smutty stuff. Maybe I'm being stupid, but these kind of movies were really only good for one thing and this film doesn't deliver much of that, leaving kind of a flat‚Ä¶"
extreme-measures,britbuffguy,7,"I had rented this one back when it came out to rent but needed to rewatch it to give it a proper review here.

It only factors at the very end and even that, doesn't really play out how you think it will.

sting-2024,britbuffguy,5,"Had heard good things from this one but what I found was a horror film about a killer spider that was a tad too cheesy for my liking. A spider crashes onto Earth and is later found by this little girl living with her family in a random apartment building, and she decides to keep it as a pet. Spider keeps getting bigger and bigger, and suddenly it's loose and wants to kill bigger things. The effects were decent, but‚Ä¶"

She discovers the ghost just wants her help to show where her‚Ä¶"

Once again, it's mostly D‚ÄôArtagnan's story, and the other Three Musketeers really don't do much of all. They really become background for a lot of this chapter. Green, as the subtitle would suggest, is probably the second star in this chapter. We get more back story, and she isn't as evil in this chapter. She gets so much more screen time‚Ä¶"
may-december,britbuffguy,6,"Somehow my library got a copy of this one, looks like it came from overseas company, as it's Netflix title that not got a physical media release here in the states.

turtle-beach,britbuffguy,5,"This one had some pretty serious subject matter, but at the same time felt very much like a Made For TV type of film. Like there is a massacre scene that wouldn't be something you'd see on TV, and while both lead actresses show some skin, it's very tame nudity. Take those three scenes out and this was pretty bland. It deals with these boats that bring refugees to a new country and the angry locals that try to murder‚Ä¶"

This and Christmas With the Kranks may be the two most unfairly maligned Christmas comedies."
duck-soup-1933,orion_a,10,"The funniest and best of the Marx Brothers‚Äô Paramount films. The best scenes are obviously the mirror scene and the ending, as well as Chico and Groucho‚Äôs first scene together and the hat sequence with Chico, Harpo, and Edgar Kennedy."

the-strangers-chapter-1,charpin96,4,Identical to the first film with few differences. Decently made but Chapter 1 does nothing to stand on its own. Maybe the next two entries will strengthen it but for now this movie is aimless and inconsequential.

heckler,charpin96,,"This is a must see. Pure garbage.¬†The single most unintentionally funny documentary ever made. The majority of it is Jamie Kennedy complaining to critics and reading reviews for both Malibu‚Äôs Most Wanted and Son of the Mask. Kennedy frames it as if we as a the viewer should feel bad for him.

Patrick Wilson going from shriveled to buff once he hit the water was hysterical.¬†I know this is a cursed movie and has issues. Let me love the Aquaman series.

they-came-together,charpin96,10,Probably the funniest movie I‚Äôve ever seen.
the-wrong-missy,charpin96,,Lauren Lapkus probably had a blast and that‚Äôs all that matters. The downside is that she isn‚Äôt very funny in it.¬†Hilarious Rob Schneider character.

undertow,charpin96,8,"Everyone stop what you are doing and go watch some David Gordon Green movies. The first 4 works in his filmography are contemporary American classics filled with richness and empathy that has been missing since the 70s.

the-holdovers,charpin96,8,Paul really on his frog shit.
thanksgiving-2023,charpin96,8,"A new essential slasher. It‚Äôs been years since we had one. Eli Roth is a favorite filmmaker so it might not be for everyone, it‚Äôs safe to say the man just does not give two fucks. Corn cob holders are stuffed in ears, a woman is seasoned and baked, and another is split in half by a dumpster. One guy gets his head obliterated by a meat tenderizer.

hannibal,charpin96,6,The existence of Ridley Scott‚Äôs Hannibal takes many steamy dumps on The Silence of the Lambs legacy. Specifically in the treatment of Clarice Starling. Even if Jodie Foster returned she would have felt like a completely different character.

spellbound-2024,xkatie,10,5 stars!!! this was soooo cute. the storyline made me quite emotional and i didn‚Äôt expect it to go the way it did. the soundtrack is amazing (it‚Äôs bound to be when alan menken is involved). rachel zegler did so good in both the songs and voice acting!! i love her so much ü´∂üèª

in-a-lonely-place,aromatasemebro,9,"Bogart often plays a slick, quick-witted professional who projects an aura of casual dominance of everyone around him, and here this persona is textualized as a sinister, mordant vessel for sublimating a violent, uncontrollable masculinity. But Ray is interested in baring the woundedness beneath, and in the frightful suspicion that paroxysmal violence from men arouses in the women whose independent lives are severely restricted by them, and by the dictates of family formation. The crime is an offstage event, an almost arbitrary imposition positioned to initiate the neurotic cycle that Dix and Laurel drive each other to, culminating in that anguishing final-act unraveling."
before-the-devil-knows-youre-dead,aromatasemebro,10,"Crushing American tragic family drama absolutely in the lineage of Eugene O'Neill, with a far more expansive characters than I had previously realized; there are no real ""bit parts,"" every little bit of it drips with abuse as belated psychic protection from having being abused."
the-big-sleep,aromatasemebro,8,"Kind of prefigures Kiss Me Deadly by crafting this clearly overencumbered narrative to draw the focus elsewhere, to the affective dimensions, to how slutty Humphrey Bogart is and to his assured safety by the prewritten need of Philip Marlowe to control the situation and top everyone around him. My pick for the wettest rain has ever looked on screen."
kiss-me-deadly,aromatasemebro,8,A grand pastiche of all that is cool and fucking stupid about noir. Ralph Meeker is sooo slutty in this
gilda,aromatasemebro,8,"Rita Hayworth's swag and outfits!!! Also a formidable picture about the internal contradictions of monogamy, muddled up a bit by its own ambition (for instance, Johnny's legal imprisonment of Gilda is a fascinating plot device that is dropped just a couple dozen minutes after it is raised, in service of the shoehorned happy ending)"
auntie-mame,aromatasemebro,10,"Some of the hardest I've laughed and the ugliest I've cried watching a movie. Would have to break into autocriticism to fully explain how much resonance it carries with my own life, but what a magnificent ode to the process of really living, against the throngs of people to whom the idea of you doing that is existentially threatening."

strait-jacket,aromatasemebro,9,"A romp that held the potential to trigger the shit out of me. But it never did, and that owes itself the sheer complexity of Joan Crawford's character, who is certainly prone to reactive anger and paranoiac, as any highly traumatized woman who lost twenty years of her life to the hospital might be, yet metacognitively aware of herself and deeply loving of her daughter (who is, tellingly, never characterized beyond the shell of the romantic heroine that she presents‚Ä¶"

trap-2024,bedtimebonzob,7,"A bananas premise, mega sophisticated visual storytelling, and a witty Hartnett performance really elevate this one, even if you have to overlook some huge logic holes and tin-eared dialogue, as always with Shyamalan. Last act is also too conventional and too stretched out. But I had a good time with it overall."
conclave,bedtimebonzob,7,"Very entertaining and nicely shot thriller, with a twisty plot and lots of fantastic character actors giving enjoyable performances. Doesn't really amount to too much, but a gripping ride throughout."
demon-seed,bedtimebonzob,7,"Wild and increasingly batshit '70s horror sci-fi borrows liberally from 2001 and Rosemary's Baby to tell a story equal parts silly and disturbing, but it's all quite finely crafted and grounded by a fully-committed Julie Christie performance at its center. Also, even though the tech itself is of course outdated, it feels weirdly relevant today, touching as it does on primitive versions of things like Siri, deepfakes, and AI."
cloud-2024,bedtimebonzob,8,"Very original crime drama with horror and action elements from Kiyoshi Kurosawa. As usual, Kurosawa understands both the dangers of the internet and how to extract dread from empty urban landscapes better than just about anyone."
thelma-2024,bedtimebonzob,8,"Charming and very funny, with just enough melancholy under the surface. Squibb is fantastic."
bad-genius-2024,bedtimebonzob,6,"Not bad on its own merits, but functionally the same film as the original, and I just don't understand these remakes of very recent foreign films where it seems the only motivation was to make an identical copy, but this time in English. The one real difference here is that this one half-heartedly makes an attempt to tackle race as well as class, but it's very surface-y in that regard, and then very heavy handed (with real ""adapted by the guy who wrote LUCE"" vibes). Just watch the original!"
look-back-2024,bedtimebonzob,8,"Beautifully made anime that manages to touch on so much in its brief runtime -- art, ambition, friendship, guilt, and more. It gets pretty devastating in its second half, and there's a part of me that thinks you could tell a similar story even more effectively without the need for heavy-handed melodrama, but I can't deny that the whole thing just works, especially the magic realist touches to do with with manga being passed under a door, which reminded me of some of the time-jumping tricks of my beloved YOUR NAME."
my-old-ass,bedtimebonzob,7,"Very sweet and charming Canadian ""summer I'll never forget"" coming-of-age film with light magic realist elements. Filmmaking is just okay, leaning heavily on some gorgeous scenery, but the performances are lived-in and authentic, and the writing is frequently sharp and incisive. You've seen this kind of thing before, but this is a strong example of the form."
longlegs,bedtimebonzob,6,"Thought from the reviews and box office that this might be a step up for Perkins from the only other film I've seen of his, THE BLACKCOAT'S DAUGHTER, but instead it just feels almost exactly like that film in both its strengths and weaknesses -- namely that it's stylish, atmospheric, and well-acted, but also poorly written, silly, and glacially paced. The result is a just-okay movie with enough strong moments to make me wish it was better."
anora,bedtimebonzob,8,"Baker's on a generational run at the moment, and while I didn't love this QUITE as much as RED ROCKET or THE FLORIDA PROJECT, it's still full of magic. Incredibly well cast."
carrie-1976,bedtimebonzob,9,"Holds up, perhaps even better than I remembered. Incredibly well-made and visually spectacular, and yet for all its operatic style, it still finds plenty of time to spend with its characters and gets lots of memorably naturalistic performances from its young cast. It also doesn't feel the need to fill the first two acts with fake scares or unneeded subplots, just a slow and steady rise before the tragic third act -- one of the best final acts in horror cinema. And oh, that final jump scare still works! Happy Halloween!"
azrael-2024,bedtimebonzob,8,"Really dug this one. Not super innovative, but very well-crafted, intense, and quite scary apocalyptic survival horror with religious elements. Haunting score and fantastic silent performance from Weaving, who's shaping up to be one of our great horror actresses."
demons,bedtimebonzob,7,"Like a lot of Italian horror, incredible on the vibes front - score, soundtrack, photography, gore effects are all top notch, and the Berlin movie theater where it's set is beautiful (wikipedia tells me it's actually a discotheque and the same building was used for Nick Cave's performance in WINGS OF DESIRE -- quite a cinematic resume!).Characters, script, and performances are not really why I come to a movie like this, but I would have liked a little more‚Ä¶"
memoir-of-a-snail,bedtimebonzob,9,"Adam Elliot returns with another beautifully handcrafted, funny, and heartbreaking paean to a very memorable group of eccentrics and outsiders. Builds to a deeply moving ending."
the-shadow-strays,bedtimebonzob,8,"Tjahjanto's maximalist, ultraviolent take on THE MAN FROM NOWHERE (with a lot of JOHN WICK underworld mythology layered in) is just as accomplished and stylish as his previous epic THE NIGHT COMES FOR US, but whereas that one left me numb, this one engages thanks to a stronger emotional core and an incredible lead performance. I still felt it didn't QUITE justify its length, but this is easily one of the best actioners of the year regardless."
redline,bedtimebonzob,8,"Visually astounding, hyperkinetic racing anime that plays like George Miller and Paul Verhoeven teamed up to direct a Heavy Metal magazine cyberpunk Star Wars. Or something. Plot and character are negligible, but who cares when there's a guy called ""MachineHead"" who has his own theme music and at one point someone says ""Mr President, we can't let Funky Boy loose like that, he's going to destroy Roboworld!"" A blast."
i-the-executioner-2024,bedtimebonzob,7,"Ryoo's VETERAN sequel doesn't have the working class cops versus rich corporate asshole hook of the first film, but does have a vigilante serial killer and lots of expertly crafted chase and fight setpieces. Slick and entertaining."
me-2024,bedtimebonzob,7,"Dark, apocalyptic short from Don Hertzfeldt, with his usual humor and strong visual imagination. Didn't gut me emotiobally like WORLD OF TOMORROW or IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY, but pretty good for something that evidently started as an extended Arcade Fire music video."
strange-darling,bedtimebonzob,4,"Two lead performances are good and it's gorgeously shot, but, er, that's about it. Built around the world's least surprising twist, and doesn't really have anything else going on. Indulgent, contrived, empty, trying way too hard from frame one. A disappointment."
the-last-of-the-sea-women,bedtimebonzob,8,"Visually stunning doc tells a compelling story filled with memorable characters, and in the process engages with so many contemporary issues, from generational differences to climate change to gender politics on down. It was interesting to watch this after seeing the great '80s Japanese film MERMAID LEGEND earlier this week, as that film focuses on an ama, the Japanese equivalent of the haenyeo, as she fights villains who are trying to build a nuclear power plant, while in this film,‚Ä¶"
hello-mary-lou-prom-night-ii,bedtimebonzob,7,"Derivative but very well-crafted slasher sequel that takes liberally from CARRIE, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and THE EXORCIST, but has a pulpy, B-Movie charm of its own."
waxwork,bedtimebonzob,6,"Campy, silly horror comedy with EC Comics vibes. Bonkers finale where all the waxwork villains come to life."
mermaid-legend,bedtimebonzob,9,"Gorgeous, original Japanese revenge film that melds art film and exploitation B-movie into an elemental fable. A slow burn that explodes into one of the great, jaw-on-the-floor endings. Loved it."
tombstone,bedtimebonzob,8,"Messy and overstuffed, yet it all still works thanks to an incredible cavalcade of 90s character actors, gorgeous visuals from the great Bill Fraker, and lovely bromance at its center between Russell and a never-better Kilmer. Also, so many killer tough-guy lines!"
in-a-violent-nature,bedtimebonzob,5,"Kind of love this concept -- both the idea of a slasher from the killer's POV and a slasher shot like an A24 movie (1.33 framing, no music, etc.), have a ton of potential. And the killer's look and weapon of choice are memorable. But the execution is iffy. For one thing, it cheats, with two lengthy scenes and several other smaller moments not from the killer's perspective at all. For another, it seems almost perversely anti-suspense. To me, the‚Ä¶"
film:85271,bedtimebonzob,8,"Technically accomplished, way ahead of its time silent home invasion thriller, containing three-way split screens and POV shots and many other cool stylistic ideas. Wild that this is from 1913."
humanist-vampire-seeking-consenting-suicidal-person,bedtimebonzob,8,"Accidentally watched two banger French-Canadian genre films this weekend, between this and RED ROOMS. This one is a very charming and original coming-of-age vampire story with a slick look, great lead performance, and a sharp sense of deadpan humor."
the-man-from-hong-kong,bedtimebonzob,7,"Ozploitation meets kung fu meets Bond in this silly and generic but very entertaining actioner, filled with gorgeous widescreen imagery, wild stunt work, and gnarly fights. Would have been even better with the originally intended star, Bruce Lee, instead of charisma black hole Jimmy Wang Yu."
red-rooms,bedtimebonzob,9,"Dark and brilliant tale of obsession, paranoia, true crime, and the internet, with one of the best performances of the year by Gari√©py."
v-h-s-beyond,bedtimebonzob,6,"Despite a new sci-fi twist, this series remains pretty mid. Still, I'm such a sucker for the found footage anthology format and this is def one of the better entries overall, especially ""Live and Let Dive"" which is among the best segments in the entire franchise. If they'd have dropped the disastrously bad segment directed by a famous actor, I'd prob bump it another half star."
its-whats-inside,bedtimebonzob,8,"Clever, fun and stylish comedic thriller, with impressive turns from a lesser-known ensemble. A strong debut that would pair well with BODIES BODIES BODIES or COHERENCE."
the-exorcist-iii,bedtimebonzob,8,"Disturbing and well-crafted sequel with a clever concept, memorable dialogue, surprising moments of levity, and titanic performances from Scott and Dourif. Love how most of the scares are created entirely through dialogue, performance, composition, and editing, with nearly all of the actual violence kept offscreen. Very impressive direction from Blatty in general, even disregarding the fact that he was primarily a novelist. Several moments in here feel positively Lynchian. Ultimately falls down a bit in its strained connections to the first film and compromised ending, but well deserving of the cult it has built up over the years."
the-night-stalker,bedtimebonzob,7,"Fun, Richard Matheson-penned TV movie that introduces the Kolchak character as he takes on a vampire in Las Vegas. It's essentially a supernatural procedural, with McGavin charming as the lead, all set to a cool, jazzy score.It's sometimes hampered by its TV-movie visuals and budgetary restrictions, and in general probably felt more cutting-edge at the time in the way it modernizes the gothic, Euro-vampire mythos, seeing as it predates stuff like MARTIN, Salem's Lot, THE LOST BOYS, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, Anne Rice, etc."
maxxxine,bedtimebonzob,5,"Liked X and loved PEARL, so couldn't help but be disappointed in this stylish but overstuffed, unscary, thematically empty trilogy capper. It's not a total disaster -- the cast is good, it's mostly well-crafted, and the super 16mm photography looks great. But whereas the other two films were built around small casts and minimal locations, this one positively sprawls, and in the process West loses all control of what his movie is or what it's about. Doesn't help that it‚Ä¶"
blink-twice,bedtimebonzob,7,"Really promising debut from Kravitz, with strong performances from the entire ensemble, a fantastic visual style, a killer soundtrack, and razor sharp editing. Unfortunately, the script is more of a mixed bag, getting worse as it goes and losing a handle on tone as things get silly and start to strain credulity. And I have no idea what was going on with that final scene."
anguish,bedtimebonzob,8,"Original, disturbing, and gorgeously shot meta-horror film that should be way better known. Would kill to see this in a theater."
sleep-2023,bedtimebonzob,8,"Jason Yu's debut is a well-crafted slow-burn psychological thriller with some Hitchcockian flair. You can tell Yu's a Bong disciple by the way every shot looks like it was meticulously storyboarded. Great performances by the two leads, and great use of its limited locations and characters."
total-recall,bedtimebonzob,8,"Melina: very demure, very sleazy.Beyond Fest screening at the Aero on 70mm. Still a blast."
the-substance,bedtimebonzob,10,"The best movie of the year and also the MOST movie of the year, a maximalist LA noir horror fairy tale that mashes up (deep breath) Kubrick and Cronenberg and Lynch and Zulawski and Raimi and Wright and Henenlotter and Carpenter and Larry Cohen and Stuart Gordon and John Waters and De Palma and Cinema Du Look and New French Extremity and The Portrait of Dorian Gray and Showgirls and... well you get the idea. It's anchored by some blunt‚Ä¶"
in-the-mood-for-love,bedtimebonzob,10,"Third viewing, but my first time in a theater (and on 35mm, no less). Still the best."
no-way-out-1987,bedtimebonzob,7,"The premise of THE BIG CLOCK, which is the main thing this one takes from the original novel, is so can't-miss that I'm kinda amazed that they still came pretty close to missing with this adaptation, thanks to a slog of a first hour and an absurd (and well known at this point) final twist. But that second half -- while implausible to say the least -- is a pretty clever, suspenseful watch throughout. Bonus points for the usual reasons‚Ä¶"

metropolis-2001,bedtimebonzob,9,"Visually astounding anime tells a somewhat generic but still involving sci-fi noir story with absolutely mindblowing imagery and design. Bumped an extra star for a an incredible finale, especially the climactic sequence scored to Ray Charles' I Can't Stop Loving You."
rebel-ridge,bedtimebonzob,8,"Saulnier returns to form after a rough few years with a killer FIRST BLOOD/MICHAEL CLAYTON/JACK REACHER riff that's tense, taut, and clever, with a star-making performance from Aaron Pierre. Bums me out that this wasn't in theaters."
the-bad-sleep-well,bedtimebonzob,9,Kurosawa reinvents Hamlet as a claustrophobic corporate noir about moral rot in postwar Japan. Fantastic.
the-fall-guy-2024,bedtimebonzob,7,"A pretty nice surprise that I still wanted to be better than it is? Love the premise, the leads, the romance, the loving tribute to stunt people, and the killer third act, but it's still full of that David Leitch frat humor of bombastic '80s needledrops and movie references instead of actual jokes, which makes it hard to fully embrace. (Also, why is Stephanie Hsu in this for like 30 seconds? Why does everyone keep talking about Metalstorm like it's great when everything we see from it looks awful?)."
snack-shack,bedtimebonzob,7,"First half of this is SO good -- confident and well-paced and smartly directed and packed with sparkly dialogue. Falls off a little towards the end as it focuses on a cliche love triangle and then swerves into unearned melodrama, but the leads are all so charming that I still dug the hell out of it."
the-killer-2024,bedtimebonzob,6,"Sort of a hard one to rate -- on the one hand, as a remake of Woo's masterpiece, it's something of a travesty, a low-rent, digital, second-rate copy that adds lots of pointless backstory while stripping out everything that made the first one so unique (namely the melodrama!).On the other hand, compared to your typical made for a streamer actioner in 2024, it's extremely refreshing -- Woo may have lost a step in his old age, but he's still‚Ä¶"
the-cat-returns,bedtimebonzob,7,"Fun Ghibli adventure spinoff can't match the imaginative heights of their best work (and is pretty slight at 75 minutes), but is still a light on its feet and amusing entertainment."
perfect-days-2023,bedtimebonzob,10,"""Next time is next time. Now is now.""""It has to get darker to make sense.""Rewatched on Criterion 4K. Round two was even better. Bumping it a half star."
oddity-2024,bedtimebonzob,8,"This original, clever, and very scary horror mystery is one of the best surprises of the year for me. Feels like the best segment from an Amicus anthology, or one of the less gory episodes of Tales from the Crypt, but tells the story in a more contemporary way, jumping through time and following a series of different characters through various hair-raising setpieces, as the narrative's mysteries gradually reveal themselves. There are few clunky moments and flat supporting performances of the kind you often find in low-budget indie horror, but they can easily be forgiven considering how compelling everything around them is. A winner."
yesterday-once-more,bedtimebonzob,8,"Johnnie To makes his THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, and it's a fizzy delight with tons of his usual visual wit (several bravura sequences are virtually silent). All the twists and double crosses get a little tiring after a while, but the movie still works thanks to the fabulous chemistry between the two leads."
kill-2023-1,bedtimebonzob,7,"Found this rough going at first thanks to dull leads and some sloppy filmmaking. Picks up considerably at the 45 minute mark with a genuinely surprising death and a late title card drop. From then on, it's near non stop close-quarters carnage, all of it inventive and well choreographed. It has some other interesting touches too, such as a main villain who's both a scary sociopath and an almost lovable fuckup, and a group of bad guys are who all‚Ä¶"
cuckoo-2024,bedtimebonzob,9,"This has a shockingly low letterboxd average, I suspect as a result of too many normies seeing it. This one‚Äôs for the freaks, and it rips. My favorite horror since WHEN EVIL LURKS."
silverado,bedtimebonzob,8,"Kinda not really about anything other than the idea of doing a Western as a big 80s adventure flick, but so well crafted, so stacked with charming character actors, and so much fun."
running-out-of-time,bedtimebonzob,8,"Johnnie To in hired gun mode, making a slick, commercial, high-concept crime film, but To being To, he infuses that genre template with so much wit and romance and longing that it puts most similar films of its kind to shame."
cora-bora,bedtimebonzob,7,"Pretty charming indie dramedy with a winning star turn from the great Megan Statler, and lots of fun LA alt comedy types filling out the margins. Eventually takes a dark turn that feels a little too heavy for the movie that surrounds it, but does go some way to explaining the character dynamics the film has set up."
doa-dead-or-alive,bedtimebonzob,6,"Cheapo video game adaptation full of very early 2000s extreme-sports meets-Maxim-magazine aesthetics has a garbage script and near universally awful performances (Jamie Pressly innocent... Eric Roberts NOT innocent), and yet is mostly a piece of trashy fun thanks to the late, great Cory Yuen's fantastic fight choreography and witty visuals. Not quite at the quality level of Yuen's equally silly SO CLOSE, but not that far away either! RIP to a great one."
twilight-of-the-warriors-walled-in,bedtimebonzob,8,"An impeccably designed love letter/elegy to a Hong Kong and a mode of Hong Kong cinema that doesn't exist anymore. Fantastic comic book style action, jaw-dropping sets, and fun characters. Takes some swings that won't be for everyone, and has a dull, flashback heavy second act, but still prob my fave pure action movie since RRR. Great use of HK legends Louis Koo and Sammo Hung as well."
what-time-is-it-there,bedtimebonzob,9,"Perhaps the funniest and prettiest Tsai I've seen, while still full of longing and despair. Seeing three Tsai films in a week really helped me feel out his rhythms. Loved this."
the-wayward-cloud,bedtimebonzob,8,"Tsai at his most original, merging his usual obsession with lonely people in dank urban landscapes with... sort of a slapstick, erotic musical comedy? Unforgettable."
i-dont-want-to-sleep-alone,bedtimebonzob,8,Tsai is the poet of flooding cities. Incredible final shot.
limbo-2021,bedtimebonzob,9,"Hong Kong neo-noir serial killer thriller in the vein of SEVEN or MEMORIES OF MURDER, with wildly dense, gorgeous b&w digital imagery and incredible trash-strewn production design that feels like something out of TETSUO: THE IRON MAN. Plot is engaging and well-paced if somewhat boilerplate, but the chases and fights are brutal and thrilling."
great-absence,bedtimebonzob,8,"Beautifully made Japanese dementia drama, structured like a mystery. Lived in, layered, and full of complex characters."
willy-wonka-the-chocolate-factory,bedtimebonzob,9,"Never seen this one, and for some reason thought it might be one of those movies you had to see as a kid to feel passionate about, but no, it's genuinely great, dark and funny and beautifully designed, with perhaps Wilder's best ever performance in the lead. Only real debit are the drippy songs."
the-transporter,bedtimebonzob,7,"One of the best, if not THE best, Besson written/produced Eurotrash B-movie, mostly because those movies are all ripping off Hong Kong guys, but this is the only that one went straight to the source and got the great Corey Yuen to direct (yes, technically it's a collaboration with the not great Louis Leterrier, but since I've also seen the truly awful Leterrier solo joint TRANSPORTER 2, I'm giving Yuen the credit for this one).The other major strength here‚Ä¶"
so-close,bedtimebonzob,7,"YES MADAM's Corey Yuen directs a female led techno thriller with some of the most aggressively ""made in 2002"" aesthetics of all-time. If you can stomach that stuff and a lot of bad CGI glass, this is kind of a blast, a twisty, fast-paced, and ultra stylized ride that never lets up."
the-big-heat-1988,bedtimebonzob,7,"To's first crime film weds a somewhat generic story to tons of fantastic action and enviable cinematic style, along with more body-mutilating gore than a horror movie. My favorite To's are the weirder, more poetic ones, but as a straight-ahead genre thrills delivery machine, this more than satisfies."
running-on-karma,bedtimebonzob,8,"Perhaps To's most wildly original film, which is saying something. What a mix of tones and ideas, so full of life and energy and then, in the film's poetic final act, so extremely moving."
abigail-2024,bedtimebonzob,7,"Very fun horror thriller with a killer cast -- Stevens and Newton are the adult standouts, but the movie wouldn't work without Weir, and she totally nails the tricky role. I agree with the critique that it takes way too long to get to its reveal, when said reveal is shown in all the marketing, but it's still entertaining both before and after that moment, so it didn't bother me too much. Nicely shot by excellent DP Aaron Morton too,‚Ä¶"
millennium-mambo,bedtimebonzob,9,"Third time viewing but first time in theaters, still really just a marvel. A claustrophobic, bleary-eyed portrait of the cycles in a toxic relationship, gorgeously shot and anchored by an all-timer Shu Qi performance. The few times where we leave the windowless worlds of apartments, clubs, and hostess bars are each breathtaking -- from the incredible opening shot to the wonderfully romantic images of snowy northern Japan. Really need to see more Hou Hsiao-hsien."
the-wrong-trousers,bedtimebonzob,10,"Rewatched to show it to my wife, who'd never seen! Still my favorite W&G short. Basically perfect. Final chase is an all-timer."
boy-kills-world,bedtimebonzob,5,"Not great, but gets better as it goes -- I'd say the second half features some of the better American studio action scenes since at least the last John Wick. Rothe is fun too, and Bill Skarsgard makes a surprisingly credible action hero. But the dystopian world is thin and poorly imagined, and the humor consistently grating."
city-hunter,bedtimebonzob,5,"Hong Kong trash merchant Wong Jing adapts the popular manga series as a Jackie Chan riff on UNDER SIEGE. The whole thing is tasteless and staged like a live-action cartoon, but there are some fun gags, solid production value, and some of the usual fantastic fights and stuntwork, even if it's far more Wong's film than Jackie's."
sparrow,bedtimebonzob,9,"Blissful crime caper from Johnnie To. Effervescent, wildly enjoyable, and filled with masterful setpieces. Like Lubitsch or Jacques Demy went to Hong Kong. Loved."
a-quiet-place-day-one,bedtimebonzob,8,"Maybe my favorite QUIET PLACE? And I'm a big fan of the other two. But man, Sarnoski did an incredible job infusing this with big emotion while using very little dialogue. Lead perfs are both incredibly good. Also, what an ending!"
new-police-story,bedtimebonzob,6,"Enjoyed Jackie in serious mode in CRIME STORY more than I thought I would, so I gave another ""serious"" Jackie movie a try, with this, an early 2000s entry in his legendary POLICE STORY series. Unfortunately, this one is closer to what I was expecting from a Chan drama, with long lulls between action and Jackie overacting wildly trying to prove his dramatic bonafides. Fortunately, the action that is there still rips, with a runaway bus chase at the midpoint‚Ä¶"
didi-2024,bedtimebonzob,8,"Belongs up there among the recent coming-of-age high points like Pen15, EIGHTH GRADE, and LADY BIRD thanks to its raw authenticity, complex characters, and excellent performances across the board. Loved the well-observed period details (even if the ""period"" keeps getting closer to now... this movie is set in 2008!), and the soundtrack, and one thing this one has that those other recent coming-of-age films don't is a male protagonist, and as such this feels especially sharp in its observations of‚Ä¶"
kinds-of-kindness,bedtimebonzob,8,"Loved POOR THINGS and liked THE FAVOURITE, but still very happy to see Yorgos back in full freak mode with his old Greek co-writer (also happy to see him mostly ditch the fisheye lens stuff for this one).Anyway, let's give thanks for a strange, dark, and original three-hour comedy! Kind of gives me a hope that a filmmaker this particular and uncompromising has found an audience."
hello-dolly,bedtimebonzob,9,"Can def see how this lavish, old-school musical flopped in '69, but viewed today it's just a reminder of everything we've lost. Production value! Movie stars! Colors! 70mm archival print looked incredible."
dead-or-alive,bedtimebonzob,6,"The incredible, hyperkinetic opening five minutes of this might be Miike's masterpiece, and the ending must be seen to be believed, but unfortunately the stuff in the middle, despite gorgeous location work and lots of eccentric details, is a mostly dull cops and robbers stuff."
crime-story,bedtimebonzob,7,Jackie Chan gets serious in this generic but very well-crafted actioner with some brutal and highly inventive setpieces.
motorway,bedtimebonzob,8,"Lean and mean, like the opening scene of DRIVE if it were a 90-minute Hong Kong banger. Gorgeously directed."
under-paris,bedtimebonzob,5,"After a great prologue, becomes decidedly dull, never making us care for its flat characters. Also, takes forever for the sharks to actually, you know, attack. Bonus points for a fun, explosive finale (even if it's too little too late), and a ballsy final beat."
gaslight-1944,bedtimebonzob,9,"Watched this in the same theater it played in LA on its initial run eighty years ago! Fantastically atmospheric psychological thriller with incredible performances, especially Bergman's."
ju-dou,bedtimebonzob,8,"An absolute visual feast of a melodrama, with an amazing Gong Li performance at its center. Not quite up there with Zhang's masterpieces, but great."
hit-man-2023,bedtimebonzob,7,"Charming, even if I wanted to like it more. Funny, smart, and sexy, with two genuine movie star performances by the leads, but I wanted it be be snappier, more stylish, and a little bit more willing to examine the darkness around its edges (I also suspect, like most movies, this would have played better for me in theaters than at home on Netflix, but I'm unemployed so it is what it is).Bonus points for what I think are not one but two clips taken from the great Nikkatsu noir A COLT IS MY PASSPORT."
love-lies-bleeding-2024,bedtimebonzob,8,"My 5000th movie watched! Fortunately, I really dug it, a gloriously stylized and sensual neo-noir with fantastic performances. Script is a little thin and it all gets a tad silly towards the end (though I loved THAT moment), but overall a great time. Glass is a talent."
immaculate-2024,bedtimebonzob,6,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   A nice-looking dud for its first hour thanks to a very weak, thin script with little depth or surprises and nothing to say, that is thankfully somewhat redeemed by a gleefully unrestrained final twenty minutes where it finally goes full exploitation, and Sweeney is allowed to really let loose.Did myself no favors by seeing this after THE FIRST OMEN, which is functionally the same movie for much of its running time, but does pretty much everything better (and yes‚Ä¶"
duel-to-the-death,bedtimebonzob,8,"Dark and nihilistic wuxia centering around the titular duel between a Chinese and Japanese warrior, which is then complicated by all sorts of conspiratorial plots, the best of which involve a gang of delightfully surreal ninjas. Shot and edited beautifully, with incredible swordplay throughout."
furiosa-a-mad-max-saga,bedtimebonzob,8,"Cool how FURY ROAD homages a moment from SEVEN SAMURAI, and then this one homages a moment from YOJIMBO. This is nearly great, and I appreciate that it's very much its own thing and not just an attempt to recapture the lightning in a bottle of FURY ROAD. The parts that feel like a Leone revenge epic are fantastic, gritty and bloody and poetic, with wonderful performances from Taylor-Joy and a never better Hemsworth, and standout new characters who feel‚Ä¶"
amadeus,bedtimebonzob,10,"Haven't seen this since I was like 15, so the premiere of the new 4K restoration at the incredible David Geffen Theater in the Academy Museum was a revelation. Feels like the last gasp of New Hollywood filmmaking, which makes its thematic concerns all the more poignant. Also, a major precursor to THE SOCIAL NETWORK, and the kind of movie that won eight Oscars including Best Picture and still feels like it maybe should have won more? Basically perfect."
mad-max-fury-road,bedtimebonzob,10,"Finally checked out the ""black and chrome"" version to prep before finally seeing FURIOSA this weekend. Prefer the color version, though both are worth checking out. Honestly, FURY ROAD would look great in any color. It's FURY ROAD. It's perfect."
symbiopsychotaxiplasm-take-one,bedtimebonzob,9,"Brilliant, way ahead of its time meta-filmmaking doc."
top-secret,bedtimebonzob,7,"Funny spoof filled with great visual gags and led ably by a very game Kilmer, but not quite successful enough to turn me into one of those people who think this is better than AIRPLANE! or THE NAKED GUN."
the-equalizer-3,bedtimebonzob,6,"Slick, generic action sequel gets by on Denzel's star wattage and gorgeous Italian locations, even if it loses points for dull villains and a paucity of action -- perhaps on the latter issue, they were writing around Washington's age?"
i-saw-the-tv-glow,bedtimebonzob,9,"Feels like a major work, a deepening of all the interesting elements in Schoenbrun's debut, packed with indelible imagery. And while we've denigrated the term by applying it to anything vaguely surreal, this is truly the most Lynchian thing I've seen in forever.Plus, I knew Buffy was an influence, but was not expecting it be such a massive one. This former Buffy obsessive identified hard."
arcadian,bedtimebonzob,6,"Mostly wastes the coolest creature design in years -- think a combo of the creatures from ATTACK THE BLOCK and THE THING with Kamaji from SPIRITED AWAY -- in a solid but generic post apocalyptic horror that riffs on A QUIET PLACE and The Walking Dead while not reaching the heights of either. Cage is great in the same haunted mode that's lead to some of his best late-period performances in stuff like JOE and PIG, but he's not in this one enough to elevate it like he could."
do-not-expect-too-much-from-the-end-of-the-world,bedtimebonzob,9,"Hilarious, biting satire, full of a jumpy New Wave energy and driven by a prankster's ethos, with one of my favorite lead characters/performances in quite a while. Ends in incredible single-take setpiece that one-ups the finale of Jude's previous BAD LUCK BANGING OR LOONY PORN. Loved this."
great-choice,bedtimebonzob,7,"Carrie Coon is trapped in a Red Lobster commercial in this very ADULT SWIM-coded surreal horror short. Well made and doesn't overstay its welcome, even if the attempt at a clever final twist didn't do much for me."
the-last-stop-in-yuma-county,bedtimebonzob,7,"Fun single-location crime thriller in the Tarantino/Coens/Elmore Leonard mold. Doesn't break much new ground, despite a surprising turn at the bottom of act two, but is still plenty gripping throughout and a great calling card film for director/writer/editor Galluppi."
woman-of-fire,bedtimebonzob,8,"Kim's original THE HOUSEMAID is the better film (tighter, more psychologically compelling), but if anything this one feels even MORE influential on the next generation of Korean genre filmmakers, especially Bong Joon Ho, whose PARASITE takes a ton from this, and Park Chan Wook, whose baroque style and love of boundary pushing content can be seen throughout (this one also has a sketchy business operating out of the upper floor of an abandoned building, just like in Park's SYMPATHY FOR‚Ä¶"
faith-2023,bedtimebonzob,7,"Yet another shot-on-a-phone promo short! This is a very fun one that feels like Na's take on a comic book movie, except it's more the stylized '90s pulp antihero version in the vein of Darkman or The Crow, with a little Matrix and anime influence worked in. It's let down a bit by a weak punchline ending that doesn't land at all, but until that moment, cool as hell. I would be very down for a feature length action film from Na (I consider THE CHASER and THE YELLOW SEA primarily thrillers, though they do both contain killer action beats)."
minari,bedtimebonzob,10,"This was my favorite movie of 2020, but I never saw it in theaters because of... you know. So to see it again in 4K in what is to me the best theater in LA (the David Geffen theater at the Academy Museum) with the great and ever-charming Youn Yuh-Jung in person, was a real treat to say the least."
chime,bedtimebonzob,8,"Another perfectly unnerving horror film from Kurosawa, with incredible sound design and brilliant compositions throughout. Reminiscent of both CURE and PULSE, except this one gets the job done in a mere 45 minutes."
the-coffee-table,bedtimebonzob,8,"Bleak, bleak, BLEAK. But funny! Sort of like UNCUT GEMS meets SPEAK NO EVIL meets the dinner party ep of the US Office. By its very premise, this is only going to appeal to a niche audience, but it's well made and acted and the director displays an impressive command of tone -- too glib and you would check out immediately, too emotionally real and the pain of watching the tragic events unfold would be too much. It's a very fine line to walk, and Casas mostly nails it, though your mileage may, and I suspect will, vary wildly."
souvenir-2018,bedtimebonzob,8,Very charming short from the Thai filmmaker behind the great HAPPY OLD YEAR. Made me miss Tokyo like crazy.
bus-girl,bedtimebonzob,7,"Story is pretty generic and somewhat cheesy underdog-makes-good stuff, but the filmmaking is excellent throughout, especially for a directorial debut. Henwick needs to be a huge star already."
sleeping-beauty,bedtimebonzob,8,Embarrassing how much better looking this is than anything Disney animation has put out in the last twenty years.
how-to-have-sex,bedtimebonzob,7,"Dug the AFTERSUN/Andrea Arnold style of this, a sort of dreamy, hazy naturalism that's very much my taste. Fantastic performances, too. Feels a little undercooked narratively at times, like a short dragged to feature length. Still, good."
nothing-except-everything,bedtimebonzob,1,Every generation gets the GARDEN STATE it deserves.
one-armed-boxer,bedtimebonzob,8,"Goofy, exciting bit of martial arts pulp, filled with inventive fights against ultra colorful villains. A blast."
river-2023-1,bedtimebonzob,9,"Second viewing, still mega clever and charming. Filled with delightful setups and payoffs. Love this ensemble cast."
challengers,bedtimebonzob,9,That's a MOVIE right there.
irma-vep,bedtimebonzob,9,Just the coolest shit. Assayas makes it look effortless. Maggie Cheung forever.
the-roundup-punishment,bedtimebonzob,7,"These movies are formulaic and all pretty similar, but sometimes genre craftsmanship and Don Lee punching people is all you need. Fun. Preferred this slightly over the last entry I think ‚Äî better villain and better final fight. Also, less xenophobia and police brutality than usual!"
infested-2023,bedtimebonzob,8,"REC meets ATTACK THE BLOCK meets LA HAINE in this stylish and witty French creature feature. Strong characters and a very likable lead, too. Loved the setpiece involving a hallway full of spiders and an overhead light on a timer."
full-moon-in-new-york,bedtimebonzob,7,"Melancholy slice-of-life about three very different immigrant women in '80s New York who become friends. Not every subplot fully engages, but the leads are magnetic and their scenes together a delight. Love the moody synth score and the controlled color palette of greys, blacks, whites, golds, and reds. As with the other films in Criterion Channel's Hong Kong in New York series, an incredible time capsule of the era."
late-night-with-the-devil,bedtimebonzob,7,"Creepy and quite clever, with a genuinely fantastic lead performance, but gives real ""we've got GHOSTWATCH at home"" vibes after a while. Also, fuck AI."
a-place-in-the-sun,bedtimebonzob,10,"Astounding noir melodrama, a gorgeous and tragic fever dream with two stunning movie stars at its center. I really need to see more Stevens because this one kinda blew me away."

joker-folie-a-deux,chandlerballi,10,Watched it the first time on Friday. Then shot some stuff for my new movie over the next two days. This is one of those that just stayed in my head and was hard to put down. Took my roommates to see it again last night. I think Ive decided im in love with this movie.

monty-python-and-the-holy-grail,sconesaregood,8,I hope that we are far enough removed from the time when this was the primary text for nerds who needed something to quote to try and be funny that we can all come back around and appreciate how funny it is every single time you see them pretending to ride horses
afternoon-clouds,sconesaregood,,Very strong Weerasethakul influence
watermelon-man,sconesaregood,8,"One of the funniest movies I've seen for a while, just non stop gags and jokes, definitely underrated as a post-golden age screwball. Also fun to hear where a few MF DOOM samples came from, I love whenever that happens."
delta-space-mission,sconesaregood,6,I love how casual the narration is. My favorite part was the big squishy green guys goofing off. Lots of fun visuals and synth sounds but also lots of scenes that go on way too long. Kind of feels like a sega Saturn game
lifeforce,sconesaregood,7,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Insane mix of Horror tones here: Alien parasite, Hammer Horror, classic universal, Jean Rollin vampire films (this is a generous way of phrasing ""a lot of the movie is a vampire played by a french woman wandering around nude""), zombie apocalypse, it's all here folks. The Every performance in this is shooting for its own extremely strange tone, it's a lot at first to manage the swings in dialogue scenes and then Carlsen shows back up and as Loose Cannon‚Ä¶"
trapped,sconesaregood,5,"At points the whole counter fitting angle is neat but on the whole pretty weak noir,"
old-boyfriends,sconesaregood,7,"Didn't realize this was written by Paul Schrader going in, I am maybe a little overloaded on his sensibility at the moment but still enjoyed it. Minneapolis mentioned. Wow is it depressing to watch this, think ""I wonder what else Tewkesbury has directed, she as an interesting and unique sensibility here that shines through even though she's not the (credited) screenwriter,"" and to then see that list of director credits."
light-sleeper,sconesaregood,8,"One of Defoe's best performances, which is a high bar. I find the image of him hugging Jane Adams very comforting. Great work from Ed Lachman too, both the scenes with nice colored lights (something he's good at doing very strongly but without it being overdone to the point of being a distraction, unlike a lot of other films with ""neon lighting"") but also scenes where Defoe and his surroundings look muted and totally drained of life. People point out‚Ä¶"
one-from-the-heart,sconesaregood,7,"Ridiculously beautiful at literally every second, which is especially impressive because it's all on a sound stage at no point could they lean on things like ""the world's natural beauty"" or ""the light at magic hour.""* This is very good because at basically no point did I find myself even a little bit invested in the central relationship between Garr and Forrest, and only really casually interested in their respective affairs. *Not to knock naturalistic lighting or nature photography as‚Ä¶"
tabu,sconesaregood,8,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Succeeds in something a lot of films struggle with, which is incorporating intentionally old fashioned aesthetics that evoke silent film without it ever feeling like a bad impression or caricature. I don't approve of cheating in real life obviously but one has to admit that in movies it can be very romantic, ""being her lover meant committing to a colossal foolishness that I could only live to regret. But in her arms, the future seemed a vague and stupid concept."" Unfortunately that future, both yours and of the world around you, catch up with you anyways!"
california-split,sconesaregood,8,"Very powerful Guys Being Dudes goals. I really could just watch Elliot Gould ramble for hours, just the sound of the film in general is a pleasure to let wash over you. Also a testament to the film that I found any of the gambling engaging, because that's one of those things that I just truly do not get anything out of. As far as I can tell gambling was invented so that that all of history's least interesting past-times could have a chance at almost resembling something exciting."
the-strange-monsieur-victor,sconesaregood,8,"Two Gr√©millon films in I think I have a new director to add to the favs list, such a stranger mix of personalities and sympathies. M. Victor is completely in the wrong but so much more personable than Bastien, simultaneous very satisfying and depressing to watch his lie eventually unravel."

apocalypse-after,sconesaregood,,"Fun to see some familiar faces (Elina L√∂wensohn, Lola Cr√©ton, my newest movie crush Vimala Pons) but suffers pretty majorly from two things: first, it gestures at a lot of subjects but is not really saying anything interesting or cohesive about any of them beyond just kind of edgy rambling. Second, it has a pretty bad case of Music-Video-Director-Itis: lots of images that look nice enough, they're stylish and have some neat lighting and evoke The Nostalgic Ideal of the Nineteen Eighties, but don't really communicate anything beyond ""aren't blue and pink gel lights cool?"""
the-rendez-vous-of-deja-vu,sconesaregood,6,"Another entry in Mubi's ""leaving soon"" attempting to psy-op me into enjoying french comedies. Generally fun, gags come at a pretty quick pace with an acceptable rate of success vs . Most worth watching for the lead Vimala Pons, who is very charming, would like to see her in more stuff. Kind of a shame that the main conflict of the plot necessitates that she's stuck with the weakest character (more for writing than performance), separated from the rest of the more entertaining members of the ensemble."
the-baron-of-arizona,sconesaregood,7,"A fun one! Most of the performances are pretty bland but that's made up for how much Vincent Price lives it up as the titular crook. The whole scenario is very novel, but it's definitely more fun when he's setting up and executing his swindle (high stakes forgeries! a false monk!) compared to the when it's in place and falls apart but the last few scenes end strong. Some very nice photography from the great James Wong Howe despite the‚Ä¶"

lady-killer-1937,sconesaregood,8,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.  Really good stuff. Gabin is great and the way rooms are filmed is really wonderful, very simple but always really well composed and blocked. It would be easy to call the end murder ""predictable"" given Gabin and the genre's conventions, especially with the English title, but how the film leads to and then follows it is very graceful."
affliction,sconesaregood,8,"Nolte, Dafoe, Coburn, Spacek: a film of wonderful, interesting faces. Absolutely brutal stuff, no easy way out. A 90s small town crime thriller used as the lie Nolte tells to keep from having to really look at himself."
sullivans-travels,sconesaregood,8,"Fun times! My favorite of the Sturges films I've seen so far. Lake and McCrea are both fun, the setup leads to a lot of fun scenarios, and the last act is especially strong.

cat-people,sconesaregood,10,"Spooky Season 2024 32Another year, another revisit, still perfect. Oliver, Alice, and Dr. Judd: one of the most evil trios of characters in all of film? Each one, with the support of broader social norms, each play their part in condescending to and pushing Irena to her doom while convinced that they're the true victims. I also noticed for the first time that in her first scene Irena has a brooch shaped like seahorses."
i-walked-with-a-zombie,sconesaregood,10,"Spooky Season 2024 31 Still an all time great, one thing I noticed this time is that earlier in the film you get more of Frances Dee's narration when things are a bit lighter and then as time goes on it fades away and the sound design of the film by the end is very sparse, practically all you're left with is those drums for the last section."
499,sconesaregood,6,"Split between finding the whole ""Conquistador out of time"" conceit interesting (effectively roots the current day footage in history and allows an efficient way to jump between locations and subjects) and not really being sure if a guy walking around in a costume like that really serves the gravity of the subject matter. Like the costume is not even suoer cheap looking to my eyes or anything like that, but in the back of my head I kind of always had ""do these people doing a demonstration about their murdered families appreciate this guy"
the-skin,sconesaregood,6,"Didn't get a lot out of this, honestly. Sorry. Obviously very interesting, under explored material material about post-war Italy but I really did not respond to any of the performances. Found each plot line (American guy, Mastroianni vs. an American woman, General Lancaster) basically boring with the film at its most interesting when no one with billing was talking and it was focused on the general population."

Spooky Season 2024 27Glad to get back to this series, sad that I only have one left after this (as far as I can tell that's the final one). In the time since I blitzed through a bunch of these last year it's been fun to watch more and more people find out about and enjoy the antics of Kudo and Ichikawa. This one is solid though I wish there had maybe been a bit more to the investigation‚Ä¶"
casting-blossoms-to-the-sky,sconesaregood,7,"Very moving, very inventive and creative on the whole with use of digital effects and green screening even if it occasionally does just look kind of hideous(but are you really experimenting or being daring with your images if you don't at least on occasion look at least a little bad?). Spends a lot of time right at the edge of my sentimentality tolerance but never quite tipped over it. Looking forward to watching Seven Weeks and Hanagatami before they leave criterion channel but I do wish I hadn't waited and could give this more time for me to sit with me."
papa-the-lil-boats,sconesaregood,6,"Can't say that I loved it, but there was some goofy fun to be had, some good gags, and Sheila White was very cute as the lead. How good must a movie really be if it's mostly someone pretty going all in on physical comedy? Nelly Kaplan has a fun director's cameo with a large dog. Gains some points from me because the dialogue, especially White's, was often delivered in a way where it was practice for listening and understanding‚Ä¶"
blithe-spirit,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024 26This isn't scary by any stretch but has a lot of ghosts and s√©ances so I'm counting it. Lots of fun, very charming cast in a novel premise. Great special effects and it's very smart when to use them versus when to just have the ghost visible. There's a gag that caught me off guard because they drive on the other side of the road in Britain. Nice technicolor photography, green is a fun color for ghosts."
ganja-hess,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024 25More vampires! I think they're probably my favorite classic monster. ""Vibes"" is probably the most overused word on letterboxd but the way this film sustains mood/atmosphere that's both disorienting and hypnotic actually suits the concept, as opposed to an action movie that like, plays a song during a few scenes or whatever.

Lots of good animals, striking photography, crazy effects throughout and especially during the last night. I loved all the different freaks and skeletons. Has a thing I like in folklore based stuff where the characters are just kind of thrust matter-of-factly into a terrible, doomed situation mostly out of happenstance or the unknowable whims of an evil spirit/entity."
the-vampire-lovers,sconesaregood,6,"Spooky Season 2024 23Has the Hammer Horror pleasures I expect: sedate but kind of relaxing pace, pleasantly warm/comfortable atmosphere for a horror, a few gnarly gore effects, Peter Cushing, but also has the added interest of pretty early example of a mainstream British film centering on lesbianism. Impressive but I'm also not trying to sell the film's daring politics too hard: while Hammer Films risked censorship and political backlash making the film and there's material for a serious textual‚Ä¶"

I don't get why people are quite so down on this one, the human plot with the alien betrayal is fun in just how telegraphed it is and Nick Adams is a lot of fun as the token American character. It's definitely tipping over the edge into Goofy Fun side of Godzilla but let's be hones with ourselves here, when King Ghidorah's heads are flapping around like noodles it's not the worst decision to lean into being a little silly."
the-edge-1968,sconesaregood,8,"Don't know what it says about me but I find this combination of elements in a film (late 60s, low budget, b&w photography in a very straighforward but not quite documentary style, non-professional actors, left politics fizzling out) to be very ""cozy."" Wrap me up in a blanket so I can have dreams about arguments about killing Lyndon B. Johnson."

Other sources online are lackluster in one way or another so as far as I can tell this is your best option.Absolutely gorgeous stuff. The visual poetry I recognize from the other Jean Epstein films I've seen utilized to create gothic tone and environment. Amazing‚Ä¶"
a-bucket-of-blood,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024 20Has a similar goofy tone to the more famous Little Shop of Horrors (which has the same writer and sets as this Bucket), but this edges out that one for me as the better film. Dick Miller is just much funnier as the timid loser protagonist and he sells his turn to killer well. The cast of characters is very charming too, fun to see the goofy beatniks respond to his art and hang out."
seance-on-a-wet-afternoon,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024 19Very good, but less spooky than I was expecting because I had previously seen Kiyoshi Kurosawa's adaption of the novel called (called just S√©ance, no time of day or weather given) where there are more ghosts.

As to be expect from a Von Sternberg/Dietrich film some absolutely beautiful shots of Marlene through lace curtains. Overall not my favorite of their collaborations though, Dietrich playing naive innocent is fun for a bit but it drags a bit to get to her having real fun as Catherine. But that last sequence from her‚Ä¶"
chopping-mall,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024 17 More goofy fun! Very cute to see Mary Woronov and Paul Blartel pop up for a one scene to play the same characters from Eating Raoul. Pretty low stakes fun time, nothing super inspired but quite charming."
frankenhooker,sconesaregood,8,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Spooky Season 2024 16Delightfully goofy. Main guy was kind of grating on me by the end, he has exactly one tone of voice and sure does a lot of mumbling, but luckily once the titular Frankenhooker has been reanimated it moves onto focusing Mullen's wild physical performance, seems like a shame to me that she's only in like one other movie. Maybe she just wasn't interested, because you would think ""former model who's pretty good at acting and great‚Ä¶"
the-funhouse,sconesaregood,7,Spooky Season 2024 15Great use of the setting. Takes a bit to get going but gets pretty mean when it does (the subplot with Amy's brother that starts out seeming like he might be able to help them somehow but instead leads to a scene where she's uselessly screaming to her family just outside for help is brutal) and the work done developing the relationship between the father and son murders adds a sense of melancholy to the proceedings.
black-christmas,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024 14Solid little serial killer film, lots of restraint with building tension and what to show. Possibly the worst cop in any film I've ever seen, smart to set up a character early on as extremely stupid when the final act hinges on someone making a dumb mistake. Fun to compare this to the film I watched previously, Pieces, because while this has a lot less ""happen"" in the plot it's not nearly as dull because Clark actually knows how to bridge between tense scenes and character work."
pieces,sconesaregood,4,"Spooky Season 2024 13Impressively trashy in its kills and gore, unfortunately also dreadfully fucking boring for the bulk of its runtime, and that's coming from someone who gets a lot out of low budget fare of the era. It was fun to see the guy who plays Bluto in Robert Altman's Popeye, though."
nightbreed,sconesaregood,7,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Spooky Season 2024 12, Director's CutLove just how crazy this gets at the end. I don't know if it really gets there gracefully but watching every shit head cop in rural Canada go crazy firing guns and boozkas before getting wasted by monsters rocked. Cronenberg is the clear standout as the main villain, his mask contrasted with his clothes and demeanor are the exact kind of creepy the film needs. By contrast, lead hunk is pretty much a brick‚Ä¶"
ginger-snaps,sconesaregood,8,"Spooky Season 2024 11""Quelle shocker!"" Amazingly 2000s, what a time capsule. A rare example of something that doesn't feel too much like 90s leftovers but came out before 9/11. What could have been...

night-of-the-creeps,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024: 8Little Underwhelmed by this, to be honest. I like the aliens in the opening scene and there were fun effects but the comedy part of the Horror/Comedy was all really weak. Really only comes to life when Tom Atkins is on screen, which thankfully happens more and more as the film goes on. Fun to see Dick Miller pop up, too. Also thought the naming scheme of the characters was cute."

barbarian-2022,sconesaregood,6,"This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Spooky Season 2024 5Fun enough! The three main cast are very good. Campbell is more grounded but plays everything well, especially the scene where she's first stuck int he basement and finds the hallway, immediately says ""nope"" like everyone says they would if they were in a horror movie, and then succumbs to boredom and looks inside anyways. I feel bad for Skarsgard, he does a good job in the setup as a normal but painfully awkward, pretty dumb‚Ä¶"
when-evil-lurks,sconesaregood,7,"Spooky Season 2024 6Refreshing to watch a movie where the main characters are immediately, from frame 1, on board with there being demons instead of wasting any time on ""could it be??? an evil demon in a horror film??"" Some pretty grisly images that ride the line of ""upsettingly gruesome"" and ""extreme enough that it's kinda funny."" An entry into the ""enjoyable downer"" genre, where everything just keeps getting worse and worse but the fun is in following along and seeing just how bad things get. Think of it like the final drop on a roller coaster."

Features a Chekov's District attorney in the form of Vincent Price, but unfortunately him showing back up means a pretty weak courtroom drama takes over the end of the film. I know it's lame to care about realism in melodramas but not having a defense attorney at all both stretches belief and undermines any hope of actual dramatic interest or back and forth for the closing portion of the film. Tierney is head and shoulders above the rest of the main cast and it all feels very perfunctory once she exits the film."

la-boheme-1926,sconesaregood,6,"The melodrama is a bit maudlin, I wish the rest of the cast was fleshed out a bit more to act as a dramatic counter to just how dour the main plot of Rodolphe and Mimi is (something Kaurismaki does perfectly in his film La vie de Boh√®me), but Lillian Gish and John Gilbert are two of the most charming screen presences ever so it's more than enough to just watch them fall in love and into tragedy together.

red-rooms,benjamin_morse,8,A movie that has the exact amount of respect for true crime perverts that I do (less than zero)
absolution-2024-1,benjamin_morse,4,"In theory I should admire the fact that this is going for a more thoughtful, ruminative crime thriller then the pure slop Neeson has been churning out the past few years, but being honest this was just really boring. He already did a better version of this exact same movie with IN THE LAND OF SAINTS AND SINNERS, you can just watch that instead of this limp attempt at a serious drama."

stress-positions,benjamin_morse,6,"a little too new york off broadway theatre for my tastes but it's mostly offset by actually being pretty funny, a nice edge of knowing satire around the entire manic ""one crazy night"" production. it's taken a few years, but it's nice that we finally have another good work of COVID art after KIMI."

anora,benjamin_morse,8,I appreciate that 95% of this movie is Baker's normal mix of gonzo slapstick comedy and down-to-earth humanism and then at the very last second he drops a discourse grenade right into the laps of the audience and walks away.

the-end-we-start-from,benjamin_morse,6,"more a construction of performance and texture then narrative, setting up the modern post CHILDREN OF MEN apocalyptic drama premise and building it through interpersonal reaction rather then any actual incident. quite lovely and sad, with a collection of uniformly excellent performances, though the obviously literary origins of the material leads the direction to some truly unfortunate moments of visual metaphor. gentle in ways that feel earned and honest, even if I maybe wished there was a little more meat to the material around these actors."
wishmaster-4-the-prophecy-fulfilled,benjamin_morse,5,"funnier and weirder then part 3, with much better actors in place. still feels like it has barely any actual wishes in it compared to the first two, but the Wishmaster being trapped by an emotional technicality is hilarious, and for some reason the entire thing is scored with dollar-store Liz Phair knockoff white girl guitar music. probably the most inexplicable of the series, for good and ill"

woman-of-the-hour,benjamin_morse,6,"95 minutes of transactional horror, the different ways women have to navigate through and around men to stay alive in the shape of true crime thrills. It almost feels like Kendrick taking this role unbalances the equation, taking a movie that's very obviously about this collection of victims and turning it into a two-hander by design due to her star power, but seeing her weaponise her charm in thriller sequences is fascinating to see. A great calling-card movie for a director."
the-shadow-strays,benjamin_morse,8,"Can One Woke Teen Survive 20 Criminal Failsons?a marathon of violence, as blissfully constructed a work of pulp homage as the original JOHN WICK. the orgiastic sense of scale to the runtime and setpieces feeling like feature not bug. Tjahjanto's dramatic sensibilities still leave something to be desired but placed in the framework of the revenge movie it feels like it flows a bit better, the simple stakes allowing for the more important elements to breathe. it's truly insane the quality differential of Netflix's international action movies vs the american stuff, like it's not even fucking close"
laura-hasnt-slept,benjamin_morse,4,Funny that Finn was smart enough to go from a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET ripoff to a RING/GRUDGE ripoff once he got to the big leagues.
never-let-go-2024,benjamin_morse,4,"Just exceptionally boring shit. So many middling horror directors think ""real or not?"" is enough of a premise to make an entire movie out of and that's how you get stuff like this, a movie with a premise and nothing beyond that to support itself. I'm no fan of the QUIET PLACE movies, but for all their faults they at least attempt to have actual genre thrills and an escalating sense of dramatic tension rather then the store brand Shyamalan‚Ä¶"
smile-2-2024,benjamin_morse,6,"""Is this...a Pizza Hut?""Structurally identical to the original SMILE, Finn using the framework of the J-Horror curse movie as an excuse for a style exercise.

the-thicket,benjamin_morse,7,"exceptionally sturdy pulp, another classic joe lansdale story of revenge in his western framework. worth it just for the Dinklage/Lewis performance showcases alone, but it elevates beyond that with Lester's steady hand on the material, jumping between black comedy and genuine weird west horror at a moment's notice. it's a crime that this somehow got dumped into the junk drawer of Tubi, it's more of a real movie then the vast majority of the standard streaming slop I've seen this year"
ghost-ship,benjamin_morse,4,"the opening is as good as well, everyone, has said but the rest of this is sadly not bringing the same level of heat. the premise is strong, haunted house shenanigans on a boat, but what should have a procedural sense of unraveling tension is instead the same late 90's/early 00's horror cliches with a slightly more william castle coat of paint on it, and frankly the HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake and EVENT HORIZON did that better. I'd love‚Ä¶"
hellboy-the-crooked-man,benjamin_morse,3,"In theory I admire a lot of the attempted ideas here-an episodic Hellboy procedural plot with an Eggers-ian gothic horror visual aesthetic-but the execution is a total mess, a cheap, boring fan-film that mostly consists of a guy in mediocre cosplay wandering around the woods. If you told me this was a Corman FANTASTIC 4 rights-holder grift situation and we were never actually meant to see this I'd believe you. Somehow still better then the last attempt to make one‚Ä¶"
take-cover,benjamin_morse,6,"SILENT TRIGGER remade for pennies on the dollar. As a gimmick thriller, it's a pretty solid one, even if I wish the CGI on these DTV productions wasn't so obviously cheap and rushed. Very funny that Adkins is forced to do an American accent but just becomes fully British again any time he yells. Pretty down the middle for one of his, but that's fine honestly, him and Statham are the last guys who are still reliable at this kind of thing these days."
the-killers-game,benjamin_morse,3,"sub SMOKING ACES horseshit, a redbox refugee that somehow got released into theatres. shocked that this was from the director of the very fun DAY SHIFT, this honestly feels way more like a Netflix original then the actual movie he made for them. bautista is very charming, but if you want to do a stunt spectacular action movie you might want to cast a guy who can actually move in his fight scenes?"
caddo-lake,benjamin_morse,6,"Compelling, confounding and atmospheric. Hard to say if it meaningfully accumulates into much of anything by the end, but the intentionally elliptical nature of what's going on makes the strange character work feel like an artistic choice rather then first time filmmaker sloppiness. Not shocked M Night saw the material and decided to get involved, the high concept premise as an inroad for family melodrama is right in his wheelhouse. A much better use of his time then THE WATCHERS, for sure."
its-whats-inside,benjamin_morse,6,between this and STRANGE DARLING it's a big year for what should be annoyingly overdirected thrillers coming out the other end weirdly charming and fun. the sheer number of visual flourishes should at some point get annoying but the constant formal change-ups never feel lazy or unmotivated. this is absolutely the kind of thing netflix should be developing/distributing rather then their general standard of unwatchable slop
bill-teds-excellent-adventure,benjamin_morse,8,what if Abbott and Costello were most excellent?
joker-folie-a-deux,benjamin_morse,2,"Prestige era MADAME WEB, the longest movie ever made.

Has any other theatrically released studio film kept in this many TV-friendly fade to blacks?"
wishmaster-3-beyond-the-gates-of-hell,benjamin_morse,2,"this is barely even a WISHMASTER movie man, it's like an episode of CHARMED with more nudity and less personality. they should have never made more of these after Divoff left, without him and a real budget for effects they have nothing left to show us"
what-you-wish-for,benjamin_morse,6,what if THE MENU was good?
a-nightmare-on-elm-street-4-the-dream-master,benjamin_morse,6,"the screenplay for this movie is genuinely incomprehensible in a ""we forgot to film a half hour of extra scenes' sort of way but as 9 10-minute Renny Harlin music videos it's pretty fun, and it also ends with Freddy Kruger rapping with the Fat Boys so whose to say if it's bad or good"
beyond-the-law,benjamin_morse,4,"starts as a hypnotic, almost HITCHER-esque desert horror thriller before instantly dropping that in service of the most boring POINT BREAK riff money can buy. charlie sheen, already a limited actor, really falls on his ass trying to go for tortured anti-hero, and the true crime aspect means that can't actually do anything fun or exciting. TV movie of the week with a feature film cast,"
apartment-7a,benjamin_morse,2,eagle-eyed viewers may notice a reference or two to the classic hollywood film ROSEMARY'S BABY :)going from john cassavetes to jim sturgess is a catastrophic differential in performance quality

wolfs,benjamin_morse,6,"Jon Watts made us a 2005 era DVD rental banger, a well-made bit of low-key crime comedy. like THE INSTIGATORS it's rude that this is going to be stuck in streaming jail rather then playing mid-day on TNT and FX until the end of time, a triumph of very modest ambitions. You would think ""what if two guys were the same guy"" would get old eventually but honestly, with these two guys it kinda doesn't."
his-three-daughters,benjamin_morse,7,"just lovely, the way this constantly sets itself up for the least interesting version of itself and then moves that out of the way for genuine emotional honesty is beautiful, a little overly writerly but that's obviously by design"

transformers-one,benjamin_morse,6,"Radioactive levels of ""Uhhh is this happening right now?"" style kid movie dialogue set against a pretty good, sturdy kid's action/adventure movie. The good does eventually win over the bad thankfully, even if the comedy isn't great it's smart enough to make the melodrama between the two leads the actual backbone of the story rather than the lore. Succumbs to franchise prequel disease eventually, but considering how silly this entire universe is I can't really get that mad at where this all had to end up. A triumph of extremely low expectations."

the-skulls-ii,benjamin_morse,3,"thankfully not as visually repellent as the first SKULLS, but without cohen's moron energy it's somehow even more boring. as it turns out a story about a slightly murderous club for rich white boys just isn't enough for a full feature film, much less a DTV sequel that's just the same movie again but with 1/10th the budget. excited to see how this epic trilogy ends at least"
the-skulls,benjamin_morse,3,"one of the ugliest, chinziest thrillers of its era, a movie with an inherently pulpy premise that strains any potential taste out in favor of empty, sub-CW melodrama. was hoping to get even some mild ironic entertainment but other then the hideously over-saturated color palate this is bad in the boring way, as it turns out the guy who directed XXX maybe isn't the best choice to try and tackle a paranoid social thriller"
rebel-ridge,benjamin_morse,9,"Eastwood-ian, one man's crusade for justice against the system doing everything in its power to crush him down. It's easy to compare this to something like REACHER, with its operator power fantasy framework, but the moral certitude pitted against the amoral rot of a small town's existence reminded me much more of a modern day BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK, the domino effect of decades of American racism brought to bare in this thematic petri dish. I have no idea‚Ä¶"
the-substance,benjamin_morse,8,"opens on a fat guy dropping a hamburger on a faded legend's cracked Hollywood Walk of Fame star, which tells you the tone and level of incisive commentary we're working at here.

beetlejuice-beetlejuice,benjamin_morse,6,"A feature length battle between an annoying, overwritten legasequel screenplay and fun, playful direction.

firefox,benjamin_morse,5,"I admire everything about this in theory, from its grim take on spycraft to its wonderfully analog old-school spectacle, but in execution I have to admit I mostly found this kind of dull. If you chopped a full 20 minutes or more of chaff out of it that'd be one thing, but this is simply too slow to work as whatever alleged thriller its claiming to be.

last-action-hero,benjamin_morse,7,"I would not say this is a particularly coherent movie in terms of satire, thematic ideas of even basic storytelling, but being honest I still don't really care. One of the only action movie satires that actually copies the visual aesthetic of the films it's poking fun at, a parody that knows the funniest thing you can do is take the bones of a great version of the real thing and just make it all 30% stupider.

What's more to say about Fellowship? One of the biggest and grand starters to a trilogy. All of this effort Peter Jackson and his team worked on shows their true passion to the novels it was based on. From the characters to the beautiful set pieces and the legendary score by Howard Shore, Fellowship is a beautiful and an astonishing film that never feels dull. Can't wait to see the rest."

surface-tension-2023,dehosure,10,"A ""Lighthouse"" esque movie that's set in Karnataka with a basic premise of trying to fix the electrical plumbing of an old house. At its core it's a character study of two different individuals backed by phenomenal performances and a slick cinematography. A great debut for a budding filmmaker."
venus-try-flap,dehosure,10,"It's the year 2028 and the story is set in a dystopian Bengaluru. With the clever use of experimental filmmaking (futuristic music, creative shots, and niche locations) all this is established. There's even a ""2001 Space Odyssey"" reference casually thrown in which will make sense only later. The colour tone shifts between colour and monochrome - Shukra is like Neo from the matrix trying to escape a ""Venus Fly Trap"" but the city and its weird characters push him to his true destiny.Special shoutout to Davis and Srikanth - they gave phenomenal performances in Surface Tension as well."

wicked-2024,laurenwilliams,10,"Went in a little confused about the current scale of the hype around this film but I was instantly hooked the moment Ariana Grande started singing.¬†Then there was a moment during ‚ÄúThe Wizard & I‚Äù when the media‚Äôs fanfare became understandable.Then came ‚ÄúThe Grimmerie‚Äù and it was like, yep, this is a great film.

juror-2,laurenwilliams,8,What a predicament.
the-shawshank-redemption,laurenwilliams,10,"It‚Äôs really baffling when people say plot doesn‚Äôt matter when determining whether a film is good or not. And this is probably the film that most strongly refutes that statement.This is the kind of story that stays with you for life. The storytelling of a plot is immensely important - that‚Äôs why this film is so adored and is considered the most widely beloved amongst all audiences. It‚Äôs so carefully crafted, everything within it has meaning. There‚Äôs so much to take away from it. The plot matters! Stories matter; for human sustenance."
alien-romulus,laurenwilliams,9,"Horrific and so intense. It‚Äôs amazing how many times you can convince yourself that the characters are backed into a corner with simply no way out and yet once again, they manage to get themselves out of it. Building that kind of tension is an art. And making the film look beautiful too?! So much talent, I‚Äôm jealous."
